Mr. Stone, I'm writing to you from Russian Federation where the ordinary people's
monthly income come to 12-25 тыс. руб. so that \$ 200-400 approx. While the income
of Kremlin officials come to 450 тыс. руб.- \$7. 000 for doing nothing in this
country and trasferring \$150 триллионов abroad every year! So why dont you make a
film about un untold histiry of the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation,
just Russia as a country, and the way the russian people have been treated in
this part of the world for ages since the 9th century. For me as a russian that
story of yours would be of the greatest interest, I believe. I have much more to
say, nevertheless...

ОБРАЩЕНИЕ. К Киеву. Вы предали Россию

(Автор: Доминик Стросс-Кан)

Французский экономист и политик Доминик Стросс-Кан, выступая на экономическом
форуме «YES» в Киеве, заявил:

— Никто в Европе не хочет умирать за Украину, даже денег вам не хотят давать,
вы в этой битве сами за себя. Ни население, ни, в особенности, деловые круги
Европы, не готовы оказывать киевской власти ту поддержку, о которой те сегодня
говорят, выступая перед украинцами.

Эти слова прозвучали еще в октябре прошлого года, но до сих пор обсуждаются в
Facebook.

Очевидно, как предполагают некоторые зарубежные издания, Стросс-Канн имел в
виду заявление президента Украины Петра Порошенко, сделанное им после саммита
НАТО в Уэльсе о том, что ему удалось договориться с европейскими странами о
военной помощи. Более того, его советник Юрий Луценко даже отметил на своей
странице в социальных сетях, что США, Франция, Польша, Норвегия и Италия скоро
поставят современное оружие Украине.

Однако все эти страны опровергли данное заявление.

Кроме того, экс-директор МВФ подчеркнул, что те санкции, которые ввели против
России европейские страны и на которые так рассчитывает официальный Киев, не
сыграют существенную роль и не изменят политику Москвы.

Приводятся и вот такие слова Стросс-Канна:

— Для того, чтобы что-то просить, надо что-то давать! Вы кроме злобы и
ненависти никому ничего не дали. Вы предали Россию, которая вас создала и
кормила с ложечки. Весь мир это знает! Запомните!

Предателей нигде не любят. Ими только пользуются.

Don't let the Western MSM rewrite history to whitewash the genocidal Stephen
Bandera, OUN, and the UPA - and those who worship at their obscene cult in
Ukraine to excuse the nature of the Maidan Putsch and regime.

"Abstract

During the past decade, particularly under the presidency of the third
Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010) there have been repeated
attempts to turn the leading ﬁgures of the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists (OUN)and its armed wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) into
national heroes. As these fascist organizations collaborated with the Nazi
Germany, carried out ethnic cleansing and mass murder on a massive scale, they
are problematic symbols for an aspiring democracy with the stated ambition to
join the European Union. Under Yushchenko, several institutes of memory
management and myth making were organized, a key function of which was to deny
or downplay OUN-UPA atrocities. Unlike many other former Soviet republics, the
Ukrainian government did not need to develop new national myths from scratch,
but imported ready concepts developed in the Ukrainian diaspora. Yushchenko’s
legitimizing historians presented the OUN and UPA as pluralistic and inclusive
organizations, which not only rescued Jews during the Holocaust, but invited
them into their ranks to ﬁght shoulder to shoulder against Hitler and Stalin.
This mythical narrative relied partly on the OUN’s own post-war forgeries,
aimed at cover up the organization’s problematic past. As employees of the
Ukrainian security services, working out of the ofﬁces of the old KGB, the
legitimizing historians ironically dismissed scholarly criticism as Soviet
myths. The present study deals with the myth-making around the OUN, the UPA,
and the Holocaust, tracing their diaspora roots and following their migration
back and forth across the Atlantic."

New prize winning American documentary that implicates the West's involvement
in igniting the Ukraine crisis. Maidan Massacre is an investigative documentary
into the shootings which occurred on February 20th, 2014, when nearly 50 people
were gunned down on the streets of Kiev's Independence square.  The massacre
was the result of a massive three month long protest against the former
Government of Viktor Yanukovich and his decision to reject a trade deal with
the EU. Although no thorough investigation had been conducted, the blame was
immediately placed on the officers who served under Yanukovich. This program
investigates the scene of the crime, interviewing those who were there when the
shootings occurred, and seeks to answer the questions as to who really was
shooting that day on Kiev's Independence square - a place known to the people
of Ukraine, as Maidan.

Фильм рассказывает о трагических событиях в Киеве в феврале 2014 года,
приведших в перевороту и свержению Виктора Януковича. В фильме звучат мнения
специалистов (профессионального снайпера, сотрудника ФБР, сотрудников МВД
Украины) по поводу того, откуда велся огонь по людям и кто, собственно, мог
убить «Небесную сотню»

Oliver Stone is a person who tries to show us the bigger picture. All what he
shows is known even befor internett was public. A little bit of research show
us what is really going on. He is one of the few americans who has the ball's
to see both site's. Spott on Oliver, bring people to think about there own
actoins. People has gone blind after all the years. People should think
worldwide instead to think only at them self. It is like a voice in the

The unfolding geopolitical chess game between Western oligarchs and their
puppet governments featured many big moves last week, notably in the Ukraine,
the Middle East and the UK. These moves have, for now, left Russian Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin, uncharacteristically on the defensive.

The game being played in the Ukraine, by what are almost certainly proxy
mercenary forces working for the Rockefellers and the Federal Reserve Board
crime syndicate, is now clearly a move to cut off Russian gas exports to
Europe. First, the new puppet Fed government in the Ukraine refused to pay for
gas, then, when the Russians cut off the gas, the pipeline sending gas to the
rest of Europe was blown up.

\href{http://rt.com/news/166532-gas-pipeline-blast-ukraine}{%
Gas transit pipeline explodes in Ukraine, 17.06.2014%
}

This was a response by the Feds to a Russian Gazprom move to price over 90\% of
Russia’s gas exports in Euros, Rubles and other non-Fed currencies. Not only
that, but, according to French intelligence, the Fed puppet government in the
Ukraine has been given nuclear weapons and is threatening to use them if Russia
moves militarily against them. This means the Feds are holding the German’s gas
and the Russian’s foreign earnings hostage through threats of violence.

That is almost certainly why anti-Fed riots broke out all across Germany last
week. It is also why Putin’s economic adviser publicly called for an
anti-dollar alliance.

It also gives us a possible motive for the probable murder of Richard
Rockefeller on Friday, June 13th. The Rothschilds, for their part, have made a
move against the other big Russian gas export pipeline running through Iraq and
Syria. The ISIS army in Iraq, run by a Saudi Prince and using US supplied
weaponry, has the ability to cut off Russian gas exports running through land
it controls. And now it turns out that Nathaniel Rothschild has begun exporting
oil out of the new nation of Kurdistan on the northern border of ISIS through
Israel.

So Putin is now reeling under a Rockefeller/Rothschild double punch

Mr. Stone, please do not treat Ukrainians as morons who are manipulated by the
USA. Since the fall of the Kyivian Rus Empire (the remains of present day
Ukraine), Ukraine has struggled to fight off its aggressors, beginning with the
Mongols, Tartars, Luthiania, Poland, Austria, Hungry, Germany and of course in more
recent times Czarist Russia, Communist Russia and present time Russian
dictatorship. The struggle for survival and freedom is not something invented by
the USA or Western Europe. Ukraine needs help from the USA and Europe because
living under the repressive and corrupt Russian regime has depleted Ukraine of
freedom, integrity morality and finances. The USA and western Europe are also not
Utopia but they are by far a better option. Also, do remember that, IT WAS THE
RUSSIANS WHO SIGNED THE ANTI NULEAR PROLIFERATION TREATY WHERE UKRAINE GAVE UP
ITS NUCLEAR ARMS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITS BORDERS -IT IS RUSSIA
WHICH VIOLATED INTERNATIONAL LAW-NOT THE USA. IT IS RUSSIAN TROOPS AT PRESENT
INVADING EASTERN UKRAINE AND IT WAS RUSSIA WHICH ILLEGALLY ANNEXED CRIMEA-NOT
THE USA. Mr. Stone please consider these facts before you fall for Mr. Putin's
deceptions and for the lure of money. consider your own integrity.
