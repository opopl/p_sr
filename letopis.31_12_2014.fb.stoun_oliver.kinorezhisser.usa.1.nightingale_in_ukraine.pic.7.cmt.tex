The darkness and oppression felt in this picture for me speaks volumes.

The same people, the same religion they should stop fighting it is wrong brother against brother!

Oliver Stone, on the side of bribe takers, extortionists, murderers and
thieves. Here Oliver Stone stands with the immoral and degenerate rather than
heed the pleas for help from common citizens tired of being abused, killed and
stolen from.

I didn't know internet was available under bridges.

That's one still from a three month story. Here's mine. Hundreds of thousands
of ordinary civilians on the streets.

Paul, no they're Oliver Stone's CIA agents and that's the Stars and Stripes in
the foreground.

No, that's not even slightly true. The take over of Crimea commenced on
February 27th when armed men forced the parliament there to appoint Askyanov as
Prime Minister (prior to that his party got 4\% support in the last real
election in Crimea) and then Russian forces started blocking Ukrainian bases in
Crimea and also taking control over other key infrastructure, airports, etc.
there were never any Ukrainian tanks sent to Crimea. There was never any threat
to Crimea or Crimeans that came from the success of the revolution. Which was,
let's remember, simply about rejecting corruption and demanding democracy,
those two things are not a threat to anybody anywhere. Show me "hundreds of
thousands" of people on the streets in Crimea between February 22nd (Yanukovych
fled) and February 27th (Crimea's parliament seized), you can not. Because it
didn't happen.

In Donbass events did not begin (now April) with mass demonstrations either. It
started with heavily armed military personnel taking over buildings in various
towns. These people. Fact. This was the start.

I was there! I saw this. And just out of shot are the men and women of Ukraine.
Armed with rocks and sticks and the odd Molotov. Standing bravely against these
well-equipped, well-armed brainwashed police.
