\subsubsection{The old dog. There is no better friend in the whole universe}

I used to say I was a hound before that I was an old dog.\par
...\par
Martha came to me like all the others did.\par
Out of nowhere.\par
She was on her deathbed and we all barely got her out.\par
...\par
After that she got thick, completely calm and square.\par
I'm sorry God but sometimes I used her back as a stepping stone.. a glass of whiskey.\par
And she silently endured.\par
...\par
The old dog.\par
She sits and looks into eternity.\par
...\par
But she knows my love for her is unlimited.\par
The old dog.\par
There is no better friend in the whole universe.\par
...\par
As always, drop photos of your pets in the comments.\par
