Mr. Stone, in your interview with Mr. Posner you state "when the government of
one's country is breaking the law, it is the right and the duty of the honest
citizen, to protest, and to support the protests of others who go to jail".

That is exactly what happened in Ukraine beginning in December 2013, when
hundreds of thousands, millions of Ukrainians, said "enough is enough" to the
Yanukovych regime, in a remarkably brave show of citizen responsibility. No
external force in the world is capable of motivating that many people to risk
much, including their lives, to go into the streets in protest of a regime that
was not only corrupt, but breaking the laws of Ukraine with criminal abandon.
Would you stand for that in the US? 

Additionally, your last posts, tweets, and interviews touching on Ukraine are
so ridden with irresponsible statements that they cannot even be taken
seriously. In the interview with Mr. Posner you also state that you never
studied history, only finding time to do so later in life.

Please do yourself a favor by continuing with this trend and reading up on East
European history. Good books to start with would be those by your compatriots
Anne Applebaum and Timothy Snyder. And best of all, why don't you visit Ukraine
to gather information, instead of getting all of it second-hand from the
sputtering Russian propaganda machine. Isn't that what every self-respecting
researcher should do?

A genuine protest ceases to be genuine when it's fueled (and financed) by an
interested third side  @igg{fbicon.wink}  In such a case it simply becomes a coup, a shift of
power from one hands to another (in this case even worse hands). I live in
Kherson, Ukraine. I have never been Yanukovich admirer, changes in the country
really were a necesity, but what happened here was not a revolution, but a
coup. Some people were really led to believe that something's going to better,
some (and a lot of them, actually) were ultra-right imbeciles used as a muscle
force to propel this coup. And all this action was artificially stirred up by
mysterious snipers, trained people, organization, propaganda and financing. All
to serve interests of certain people and certain parties. Oliver Stone asks you
to see the bigger picture, and you clearly don't want to see it. Moreover you
offer to read Applebaum and Snyder, those are purest propaganda, not a history
literature.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

@Maxim: exactly. The Ukrainians are blind. And those who can see are threatened
and shut up....

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

those heroes then proceded to slaughter those of their countrymen who did not
agree with them. The massacre at Odessa spells the end of a unitary Ukraine.
Had they simply wished to exercise their democratic rights, there were
scheduled elections on the way - they did not need to carry out a coup d'etat.

\iusr{Joanna Prisiajniouk}

Pro Russian brain washed posts! You all forgot about Holodomor! Be careful of what you wish for!!!

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Eric Kraus sorry to tell you but there were no scheduled elections on the way
(1 year and half is a very long time) and the previous one was just a joke so
no any real chance of a fair one. The early election proposed by Mr. Yanykovich
were followed by the order to disperse the square probably with the intention
of repliacate the Bielorussian experience (this is only an opinion no one can
know what was in his mind). On the contrary current war in Ukraine (I don't
speak about Odessa massacre since it will be only my opinion) has created a
unitary State. It was Mr. Putin hope that Ukraine would fade after the invasion
in Crimea but his plan failed and now Ukrainian are much more unite than before
and than you can think.


\iusr{Demetrius Kolczyński}

Where did you get that "A genuine protest ceases to be genuine when it's fueled
(and financed) by an interested third side"? That's the way things are in
Russia's world of slavery. But Ukraine is a different case. For a long time
now. So better gain some balls to create genuine protest)))

\iusr{Rainer Schulte}

Wars are made for ENERGY DOMINANCE- and Ukraine got in this whirlpool! of
international interests. I am very sad that the Civilians pay for this- loosing
their homes and be killed. There must be a solution- but with a Presindent
saying WE ARE READY FOR WAR is not a help. UKRAINE should be a NEUTRAL COUNTRY-
like Switzerland. But now they lean to the WEST. Remember Germany does not
exist legally- we are still occupied by ALLIED forces and even pay for this
every year! We need PEACE in EUROPE and a powerful economic structure- and this
includes Russia- which has enough internal problems to be resolved, too. But in
any case, Russia is an important trade partner for any country in Europe and
Asia. Make Business- NOT WAR! You have enough resources to be a free and
powerful country- so you all should try to go this way.

\iusr{Cannibal Christoth}
Lol

\iusr{Vadym Ivanynyuk}

Amen! What is in American constitution - can be applied to any country.
Yanukovich did everything possible to call this protest from Ukrainians.

\iusr{Daniel Rajala}

Oliver Stone who is one of greatest filmmakers of our times intends to mire his
hands in the dirt and sleaze of Russian lies against a nation wanting democracy
and human rights against provocateurs, liars, manipulators and thieves of
Russia who want to steer Ukraine into similar system of destruction of freedom
of speech, quash oppositions to ruling regime, and eliminating a chance for
improved human rights against the state system. Don't tar your mighty name with
a massive list of masterpieces with this trite, disgusting shit about CIA
manipulating Ukraine.

It is more than plain and obvious that the people were fed up with their
leaders who failed them - with big help of Russia - yet again. Coup succeeded,
but then started annexations and Russian-style aggression to take regions of an
independent country. The problem with Ukraine turning to west is that without
doing it Russia would weaken and maintain in it poverty and undeveloped for
long time. Corrupt officials, corrupt leaders, corrupt army would linger on,
who doesn't want to change circumstances if you live in a desperate and
hopeless situation without seeing improvement in your horizon... Stone don't
drown in this cesspool of lies and moronic rubbish...

\iusr{Emil Wojtechko}

Oliver Stone seems to be as corrupt as Putin and Yanukovich. Mr. Stone why
don't you visit Ukraine instead of buying the Russian Propaganda? Is it that
Yanukovich and Outin are paying millions to have you spread their propaganda?
What about the a Ukrainian a People? Don't they have a right to their language,
culture and country?


\iusr{Roman Makuch}

How was it a coup? After Yanuconvict left, the elected Parliament followed the
Constitution. That does not make it a coup.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Ok, Then why don't you tell us, MR Stone, whose idea it was to create this
movie and who paid for it? I don't think you are doing this from your own
pocket. Also, why are you calling Ukrainians Nazis? are they going to Russia to
kill russians? Has russian person ever been pressurised in Ukraine? you have no
idea what I had to go through just for speaking my own Ukrainian language in my
own country! If you fight with American government then go and live in Cuba or
Africa, or Russia! Could you? Give some land to American native indian
population!

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

\iusr{Vincenzo Lachimera}

You were never persecuted for speaking Ukrainian in Ukraine, that is a lie.
According to google 93\% of Ukrainians choose Russian when given the options at
the ATM cash machine. Putin and Stalin are not standing there with a gun
forcing them. What you are saying is you are from the west of Ukraine, which is
not really traditional Ukraine but Poland and once Lithuania. When this war is
over we will see the borders looking more like they did 100 years ago, and you
can go back to speaking the language of your ancestors, Polish! The Russian
people who have been trapped inside the false Soviet creation that is the
present borders of Ukraine will go back to being within Russian territory just
like Russian republic Crimea. The beautiful Russian culture that is Odessa will
be free of the humourless Ukrainians and murdering Banderovie!

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Another one that knows better from Vancuver. How do you know where exactly Im
coming from and my family? and your knowledge of ukrainian history sucks! and
it's not about ATM cash points' language, it's more about the attitude
everywhere you go (transport, events, radio and television etc). Please, do me
a favour, go back to google and learn more.

\iusr{Nestor Miguel Gorojovsky}

Nobody is calling the Ukrainians Nazis. Stone is calling the Nazis Nazis. There
are Nazis in Ukraine. And they share in the rule of the country with
neoliberals who always are cozy with Nazis. They pretend to be "the
Ukrainians", and they are not. That simple.


\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
a good description of Yanukovich himself and the people around him!

\iusr{Steve Poe}

In the current Ukraine people get assaulted in the street by Ukrainian
Nationalists and told to speak Ukrainian. That is in the city where Russian was
spoken since the city was founded.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Steve, do you live in Ukraine? Only your name itself says you have no idea what
you are talking about! Washington is quite far to understand the situation.
It's like the spanish language speakers (and you have them thousands in US!)
told you to speak spanish and not English. We are called ukrainians, we have
our beautiful language and traditions and russian population don't respect it.
But what can you know living in USA and typing from the sofa in Washington.

\iusr{Martin Schröder}

"Are they going to russia to kill russians".. uh yes. They go to russian parts
of ukraine to kill russians. Instead of letting them be part of Ukraine. These
russians are born in ukraine so it's their home and they don't like being shot
at in their own homeland. Ukraine has some kind of autoimmune disease like a
cancer or something. It is killing off it's own organs. Like a kind of suicide.
Who pushed Ukraine into this downward spiral?

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Oh well... from Sweden you know better, boy. Let me open your eyes abit and
enjoy more your beautiful life in Sweden. Stalin created Holodomor (1932-33)
also known as years of hunger. He killed millions of ukrainians on the borders
with Russia and sent there criminal russians to work on the mines. What
homeland for russians you talk about? They been sent there to destroy my
nation, ukrainian nation.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Martin you are not Ukrainian or Russian , you don't know what are you talking
about... Work , collect pension in your country ... If you support Nazi , then
Nazi chambers is your place , no pension ...lol

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Nazis are Nazis, no other name

\iusr{Александр Янчук}
No, Victoria, Kiev sent their troops to kill Ukrainians on the east.. And this is in fact. This is worse than to kill Russians I believe so.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
In that case, Александр янчук, Russia sent their troops to Abhazia, Chechnya, Prednistrovya to kill russians?

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

You are being unreasonable... you cannot understand ukrainian soul for the
reason you're not being one and had never lived in USSR. The torture ukrainian
nation went through being under the reign of Russia till the present day is
tremendous! It is better be under the reign of USA than with russians. You
should of just went to live In Russia and then have a conversatuon with me.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
Its all provocatiins, Gerard.. provocations only.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Russia wants to take the land of Donbass as its rich and full of mines with
coal. The people in Donbass is nothing for Russia as they didnt even move the
finger to help refugees from there! They are dumping a huge pile of shit on
them! The only thing they care is the land!

\iusr{Soldiers are not heroes, they are tools of war.}

Glad Mr. Stone has the courage that so many in the mainstream lack. Truth
tellers are rarely liked, and I'm glad Oliver Stone is willing to say things
that aren't popular. Unbending beliefs get people killed, whether that's an
unbending belief in a god or a belief in a nation. People are never open to new
information when they hold so strongly to their often misguided beliefs.

Hello!!! Kiev and the western Ukrainians are killing their own people, or

the case then they are trying to kill anyone that thinks differently than them.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Everyone with a little brain knows what happened in Ukraine. It was clear from
the start. It was well planned and organised coup d'état against legal
gouvernment, with first goal to replace it with pro-USA puppets and idiots.
Second goal was to use Ukraine situation and with controling of new gouverment
to move them against Russia. And third goal was to move Europe against Russia
by creating crysis and false treat. To destroy all relations between Russia and
Europe, to make economic problems for both of them and in the end to again make
Europe depend from USA. Sad thing is that all of that worked for now.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Well Yulia nobody want to depend on anybody. I can agree with that. We all want
to be free, but sad thing is that we dont live in that world. For Ukraine was
maybe the best option to be neutral but as we saw nobody want you let to do
that. But Russia is in border with Ukraine with large population of Russians
who live there and your economy is similar to Russian so you have naterul
conections with them... And Europe, Europe only needs from you cheap labour and
cheap resources. USA dont need even that, they just need some point where
relations between Europe and Russia will broke... and Ukraine is ideal, deep
divided country...

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}
Luc, at least they are much more calmer then USA, as we saw in every contry in which USA come is war and misery...

\iusr{Igor Des}
If it was "clear", the facts certainly don't support it

\iusr{Юрий Сорока}

How can people be so stupid? If Russia is so smart and good, regardless of the
"coup" they should have just obeyed the international laws and agreements and
honored Ukraine's sovereignty. So Ukraine and Russia would've been friends.
Instead, Putin invades Crimea and Donbass, causing immense manslaughter and
humanitarian disaster.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Problem with that coup was that it wasnt supported by some of half Ukraine
people. Problem was that majority of Crimean population are Russian, that in
Donbass live people who are conected with Russia, which whole economy depend on
Russia. Problem for Ukraine is that man from Lviv and man from Donetsk dont
want and dont think the same. That is a problem for Ukraine and not imaginary
Putin invasion. Sure Russia supported east (guns,ammo, some soldiers), but also
we know who supported coup. So aim of all that was that you and Russia wouldnt
be friends any more (you have good relations with Russia and EU). And well
Crimea they choose their destiny, they decide to go and who can blame them.
That is how it work, it is called democracy arent. That Maidan guys nobody
normal dont want to have around his home. So you are stupid if you dont see
where your country go, that you have deep divided country and that problems are
just started, only good thing in all that is that most people in Ukraine (no
matter on side which they are) are good people and dont want to go to war
against each other.

\iusr{Ed Kromskoy}

Vladan, in every country where russia came is war and misery. Moldova, Georgia,
now Ukraine. Also they have enough internal conflicts. You just prefer to put
blind eye. This is very short history from 1991, before that USSR was
responsible for many wars.

\iusr{Ed Kromskoy}

Vladan, ukraine is more united than ever. stop watching russia today. yep,
perhaps 15\% of populations are not happy with the choice and would prefer to
build back ussr. it is never good for everyone.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

In Moldova there is no war. Georgia, as I remember very well all started when
their idiotic president decide to bomb his own people, kill some Ossetians and
with all that some Russian soldiers. So in the end even Georgians alone decide
to move that idiot, and where he go, in USA offcorse. And Ukraine was good
until you start received USA advices. Russia today, I dont need that to make my
opinion. We live in informatic society where informations are easy to reach.
15\% well we both know that it is not truth, just Russians in Ukraine are 17\%.
And I am sure that except members of communist party most of them dont want to
see USSR back., but they want to stay close to Russia and to not become another
American puppet.


\iusr{Lida Zinko}

I am so tired of hearing that what happened in Ukraine was "a coup" - just
repeating of Russian propaganda. The street protest is the ultimate, hands on
exercise in democracy, This was supported by majority of Ukrainians, a coup is
overthrow by a SMALL FACTION.. Anyway, since the so called 'coup", there was
legitimate elections, so this is moot point already

\iusr{Piotr Chmurnik}

In Moldova (Pridniestrowie) Russian occupation troops are stationed. In Georgia
also has troops occupying (Abkhazia, Ossetia). The Crimea was illegal
referendum. It does not matter from where the majority speaks Russian. The
future of the territory may exclusively authorized to decide the whole nation
of Ukraine. Deciding can not only part of the nation. Neither the Russian army.
I'm sure putler, would not agree to any part of Russia disconnecting after the
referendum.

Vladan, you are 100\% right with your evaluation of situation and it does not
make sense to discuss here anything with Ukrainian people, today they are all
under umbrella of their anti Russian propaganda and will decline all facts
converting them to their internal "true". But sooner or later they will
recognize that Western who was actively pushing them out of Russia and there
they all so willing to live (but in fact will only get some cheap work) is not
going to pay for it, closed all borders for entrance, we already see it now
after one year that Ukraine is close to default and nobody except Russia (still
!!!) want to give them money ... I am sure that smart people (and they
definitely does exist in Ukraine) will soon change their mind who is friend and
who is enemy.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

They just show how easy is to manipulate with people. And they are manipulated
with false hopes and promises. And offcorse that nobody give them money,
because there is no money, at least for Ukraine, they are just too big and too
poor, 44 milion people who can finance that. Europe dont have money for that.
Eu and all that... it is even crazy to think. I understand that is so nice to
live in dreams but it is also very useful to come back to reality and use brain
from time to time.

\iusr{Yuriy Gruzglin}

Vladan, perhaps you should make a trip to Ukraine, go see Kiev, Lviv,
Dnepropetrovsk, travel to Donetsk and Lugansk (it is the city where I was born
and lived for 40 years). Talk to people everywhere you go, listen to what they
say, look around.

You are thinking that in this informative world you know a lot but it is not
necessarily true: if you trust sources that are not impartial so will be your
conclusions. You seem to know all the answers upfront.

And by the way, this may be an unexpected news for you: today Ukraine is more
united than ever in its history.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Yuriy, well before all this I planing to visit Ukraine (In fact Lviv and Kiev),
but now, I survived one war and I think that it is enough one per life  @igg{fbicon.smile}  Even
if there is no fighting, atmosphere in society completly change, and that is
just not it anymore. As I was born in country which was destroyed in bloody war
(much bloodier then this what you have) and all this what happen in Ukraine I
allready lived (War,"Better life dream", propaganda, "We are more unite than
ever", "Evil enemy"...and then comes Selling factories, higher prices, more
corruption, loosing independence, unemployment and eternal instability). .
Problem is when you are in situation like Ukraine is that you dont see things
racially. You have worst possibile government now, USA puppets, ideal for
manipulation (Bad past, a lot of things to hide, some of them are openly
nazi-well now they hide it, it is not so european), you think that Yanukovych
was corrupted wait them a little. Probably only normal guy there is Poroshenko.
And as that united thing, well some parts of Ukraine wants to go, that I dont
see as some unity, and incredible only thing which save them in Ukraine is
Russia (because even Russia dont know what to do with them).

\iusr{Юрий Ко}

United Ukraine? First it is not the truth, otherwise who are all these people
in Donetsk and Lugansk, second if you remember, people in Germany were also
quite United during Second World War with small exclusions, but it does not
mean they there on the right side... Propaganda can make incredible influence
on people and this is now happening in Ukraine, people do not understand now
where is the true and what is good and what is bad.

Keith, attacking Russia's human rights is a red herring in this debate. Mr.
Stone has made no comments about Russia at all. When Khrushchev denounced
Stalin for millions of murders, do you think he was somehow pro-Hitler? The
enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend!

As an aside, the treaty you mentioned is the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on
Security Assurances and isn't a treaty. In fact, according to the State Dept in
2013, this memorandum "is not legally binding" as no country has ratified it
(see \url{http://minsk.usembassy.gov/budapest_memorandum.html} ).

However, in 2014, the State Dept decided that this Memorandum is indeed a good
weapon with which to attack Russia (see

If the US legitimately believes Crimea was 'annexed' by Russia against its
will, why is the US government punishing the Crimean people with sanctions?
That would seem like a petty, spiteful act unbefitting of the great 'policeman
of the world', who we all of course look to for moral guidance.

Yeah famous MH plane, it is a joke, and nobody even mention it, as we know
there was some investigation but still there is no result arent... and Crimea
well that is called democracy, people voted and choose their destiny... I dont
remember that there was some voting when they overthrow legal Ukraine
gouvernment.

Putin will be crushed as the U.S.S.R. was .Watch and see .The Ukrainians have
no desire to reestablish the Warsaw Pact but want to join the other western
democracies and N.A.T.O.

Please don't say that Russia has provided any evidence, it is a joke. They
changed their version 3 times from the beginning and everythime using different
"real" documents. I don't know who shot the MH17 and I hope that the
investigator will find out and punish the responible was it Ukrainian, Russian
or of any other nationality. The only sure thing for now is that it was hitten
by an external object.

One think is for certain... ignorance breeds ignorance. So many irresponsible
statements by Mr. Stone and other RT (Russian Truth) viewers like Johannes
belie the fact that Ukrainians are suffering, being maimed, tortured and dying
in Eastern Ukraine at the behest of Vladimir Putin. I wonder how much of
Yanukovych's blood money it took to try and sell this fiction. When will the
movie come out?


\iusr{Gary C. Gregg}

What a load of tripe - an Ameriican questioning Russia's human rights recoord!!
Priceless!! Regarding MH17 - show me the evidence. Regarding Crimea, what about
self determination? People and Principles enshrined in the United Nations
charter and international law. Crimea choose to 'come home'

\iusr{Keith Cline}

Your English syntactic is way off .Even though you have English sounding names
I doubt your validity .Obviously English is not your first language. Perhaps
Russia paid you to spread this propaganda ?Putin has every desire to once again
spread my any means the territorial expansion of the former U, S, S, R. Putin is a
thug and a egotistical gangster. Democracy has been killed in Russia and the
Ukrainian people want no part of it ,but want to join the free world of
enlightened democracies and the rule of law that exists their .

\iusr{Gary C. Gregg}

I’m sorry you don't like my syntactic structure. I was simply asking you to
back up your arbitrary statements and rants with some hard facts and evidence -
which you seem incapable of doing. S novim godom!

Regime change is one of the methods of US intervention. The first regime change
for the information of trolls is that the ouster and assassination of Lumumba
in Congo. Other most notable regime changes, are in Iran, South Vietnam, Chile,
and Libya.

\iusr{Keith Cline}

John you right ,this goes back hundreds of years by all empires .But does this
justify Putin.Putin will pay ,he has bitten off way more than he can chew.What
would Ukraine want to do, be a member of the E.U.or a satellite of Russia .Why
do the followers of Stone have a derogatory name calling persona about them .Do
they think that is an effective strategy to convince people or is it that the
messengers of evil just can't help being that way.

\iusr{Александр Янчук}

Keith, why you have so much hate in your heart to Russians? Did any Russian
offend you? If so, I can bring my apologies to you. But please don't spread
this around. I'am Russian with Ukrainian roots. You are sitting on your bike
10000 km away in US thinking about Democracy, but I live 200 km from the war.
What you know about Russians and Ukrainians? Do you really think all Ukrainians
want in EU? If so- it's just your personal point of view but it doesn't mean it
is correct. The coin has two sides, you're looking at one only. In such way you
will never find the truth. Vivat Mr. Stone! Open their eyes, let them see what
they do!

\iusr{Olena Volkhonska}

Dear Mr. Stone. I can understand your desire to uncover conspiracy in what
happened in Ukraine. But you should not underestimate the inner will of the
Ukrainian society to return to Europe after 300 years of colonial dependency on
Russian empire. Maybe the bigger picture you were looking for is that Ukraine,
which had no state for centuries kept its identity and will for independence
transferred from generation to generation. Look at our history, find out that
Russia started to call itself Russia only starting from 1700s. Who had this
name before? And by the way Mr. Yanukovich is not only most corrupt President.
Discover his history, his criminal past. And stop living in paradigmae of the
XX century.

Fine, as long as you let anyone who does not want any part of your "glorious"
Ukraine to go there their own way, and NOT "suitcases, train station,
Moscow... everyone gets to stay on their ancesal lands... the Crimea was a
perfect case. I for one am sick and tired of Ukrainina "democracy" - which
seems to require street demonstrations any time one side does not get its way.
Europe would be wise to back away from such a dub


\iusr{Стефен Эберт}

meant to say "dubious track record". You can have your own identity, just NOT
over the dead and bleeding bodies of a huge minority. Study the U. S. and Canada
with their own French and Hispanic population to learn the right way... then

\iusr{Илья Сметанин}

Three hundred and fifty years ago the territory of Ukraine was 8 times less
that you have now. Since 1654 till 1954 you had been granted the rest of the
territory by Russian tzars and emperors, Stalin, Lenin and Khrusсhev as the
sign of ever lasting integrity. Time to leave for Europe with Dnepropetrovsk
and Zaporozhie. Kiev is to be left by the way

\iusr{Olena Volkhonska}

Stephen Ebert, if you want to live in Russia, you come to Russia and live
there. Instead, Russians invaded our territory and fight there. Should we
oppose occupation? Do we have to fight against aggressor, should we return the
motherland to thousands of hundreds who left Donbass and hide from war in
Ukraine?

Olena, would you in full honestly heartfelt answer deny that without the ultra
right groups of direct Fascist origin (in fact, they PREDATED Fascists when
they were a part of the Skoropadzky Hetmanate under the orders of the German
High Command) there would have been an overthrow of Yanukovitch? By the way, I
guess Maidan was intended to bring the oligarchs out of Ukraine, what I see is
the oligarchs taking the country in their own hands. OOPS

\iusr{Vincenzo Lachimera}

Lets be clear, the Rose revolution was not a revolution but a US financed and
plotted coup just like in Ukraine. Saakashvili invaded Ossetia at the bidding
of USA. Putins response to the aggression was slight considering the threat.
Any Georgian leader who conspires with USA against the Russia is responsible
for the Russian defensive response. Sakaashvili is 100\% responsible for what
happened in 2008!

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

unfortunately, you are to blinded by the propoganda to realise that Mr Putin
has put you through nothing at all - it is the Americans who played you for
fools - and with your country broken, impoverished and in ruins, will continue
to play you for the foreseeable future.

\iusr{Александр Янчук}

Marishka, if your people from Georgia fights against rebels in Donetsk that
means they can do that? Why Russian can't help to rebels? Do you think that
you're allowed to do something and other people don't? Why you hate so much
Russians? What was wrong with us? In such way we suppose to destroy Georgia
because of Mr. Dzhugashvilli? But we don't do that because we can't sweep our
feet on history, no matter how it was good or bad. It was our history. But you
can, I presume. I wish you're Georgian ppl will finally understand they wrong
and turn back to Georgia.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Aleksander : maybe because Ukraine is a State and his defending his border ?
So it is legal for international law to provide help defending while is illegal
to invade ? If we use your logic then UE, USA, etc can go in Cecenia or Siberia
and help the local popolution to get out of Russia ?
