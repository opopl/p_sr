An old postcard of the City, the Palace of Culture of Koksohimzavod, the 60s, then the D/K Markohim, then the Mariupol Chamber Philharmonic! 💐🥰
In the terrible days of March 2022, me and my family and more than 1000 people took refuge there from the explosions... I'm so happy to see you in the future.
The director of the Philharmonic Kryachek Vasily Mikhailovich and the employees of the Philharmony did everything they could to save People! 💐🥰
I bow to you for saving me! 💐💐💐💐💐💐💐
