Every day I am asked a question whether it is possible to return to Kharkiv.

And everyday I say I don't have an answer.

It all depends on your level of anxiety.

I saw a pensioner on Buchma Street, to whom a humanitarian aid was brought. To
the sounds of explosions, he told me: "It's loud on North Saltovka, but it's
still normal here."

I saw people sitting in the subway for two months. Some people are so
comfortable, some just have nowhere to go, and some are really scared. Once on
Cold Mountain, a psychologist told me about a local girl who once heard the
sounds of explosions, refused to surface.

Yes, our cats have moved the orcs, and for days the barrel artillery has been
out of service in the city. But that doesn't guarantee that the unwashed won't
hit with something more serious. I’m not intimidating but y’all have to really
look at things when you’re making a decision.

The people in the city can only provide you with the facts. Yes, Kharkov has
become much quieter. No, the war isn't over.

Are you willing to take the risk? What about the family? By the kids?

No one will make that decision for you.

No one will give right answer.

Because he doesn't exist.
