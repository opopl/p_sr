Это не украинцы атаковали Руси, только Россия напала на Украину. То, что Россия бандит.

\iusr{Тата Аталон}

Россия- страна агрессор, подлый и низкий. Это говорю вам (специально с
маленькой буквы- без уважения) украинка из русскоязычного Харькова. Я презираю
вас.

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Says russian who lives in Canada))) what a joke))

\iusr{Arthur Rogers}
Showing the truth is especially hard when you are lying.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

I don't think you are real Ukrainian, ; to make war in Ukraine is your choice,
but not to make piece; ; to make conflicts in Canada is not your business, you
are really behind hundred years , you need more education, I think, or just to
be a human...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Time will show the truth...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
To: Tata;
Russia saved your brothers and sisters from Nazi, some of them were killed and burned during War 2
You need more education and just read
The History , if your Ukranian older relatives did not tell the past

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
To Tata : Symbol Hitler'ss on banner in Ukraine

"Russia saved your brothers and sisters from Nazi"

BAHAHAHAHA yeah right! But first they became close Nazi allies to help them
train and build up Hitler's army in order to split up Europe. Soviet and Nazi
troops training together as brothers, performing on common parades, kissing and
hugging on old photos. :)))

I will file a petition to put a nazi symbol, or two  @igg{fbicon.wink} , on every flag of the earth.. becuz it's kewl..  @igg{fbicon.wink} 

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Your choice... You will do it probably , because different time now , and no
option to go Nazi chamber for you yourself .,. Only jail for your safety ...


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Yaroslav Zadorovskyy , I live now and don't support Nazi, if you are ...
Waist of time to talk with you that's why war in Ukraine ,

Probably people like you or other who brainwashed and put Nazi Symbol on
Ukrainian Flag...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
File petition Martin Schröder, but before doing this Don t hide photos in your file ...
... And go to hell

\iusr{Христина Грищук}
Popóv or Pópov, why you live in Canada?! you have to live in your the best ever ruSSia

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Russians saved?? Really?? Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement killed how many?? Russian invaded Poland ..if that is saving they you are more dump the I though

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
You mistaken I don't suppprt SS, you sounds , you are , Gryshchuk,
Sounds angry, that's why war in Ukraine , don't think you should live in Ukraine, it's not your Country , yours is SS place

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
I m sure , once the border will be open, you will run away from Ukraine,,

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Yes, many mistakes of politicians in the past and now , the fact is Russians
won the war , and russian people were killed by Russians , same as in Ukraine
now...many soldiers died for Poland against Nazi , I saw cementary in Poland.
Polish people respect Russian people , who fight for them .,, Russians don't
put SS symbols on Russian flag, Some Ukranian do..

Why ? Do you have explanation?


\iusr{Rob Decoup}

Nikolai you would also be angry if Russia invaded your country and killed over 5000 of your citizens!
Dont listen to russian propaganda.
Biggest nazi is the little man in the kremlin!

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

Nazi Symbol on Ukrainian Flag...

1. Ukrainian flag does not have any symbols on it - just Sky blue and light
yellow  @igg{fbicon.smile} 

2. That's not a Nazi symbol, but an old rune. Soviet symbols are also
prohibited in EU for example, but that makes me wonder why nobody from EU
accuses China or US for using five pointed star on their flags :)))

3. Finally, Putin is and always was widely supported by neonazi parties that
shout Russia is for Russians only etc. Their parades are full of young people
with neonazi flags mixed with soviet symbols and ultra-right slogans. Why don't
you say something about that for a change?  @igg{fbicon.wink} 


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Mark, I against any Nazi, don't understand your point ... But I can see
Ukranian flag on background... What does it mean ?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
On it , or with it (about symbol on flag)
no big
Differents , Some
Not people with Ukranian flag marching with Nazi flag , and people like you don't stop them ... That's why war in Ukraine... I love Ukraine and love good Ukranian people , who stands for Peace .

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Rob , how you can prove about Russian people? Do you live in Ukraine? In
Russia? Did you see that ? Do you have evidence ?

Why for expression opinions and trying to find the true , people from Ukraine (
they are not real Ukranian) wish to die to mr Oliver Stone and all supporters
(???) is it not Nazi people...(???), why they put together symbol of SS and
Ukranian flag , and why they don't stop yet,,,, why support them ?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Yaroslav, it's not just about symbol, it's abou angry and hate...

This type of people want to build life , piece, based on Angry , hate , wishing
to die or kill other people... even to torure them ..: do you support them ???

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Why many countries separated from Russia, most of the without killings, ???

What happened in Kiev ? Why People killing each other ??? Who is who ? If you
have prove , just put in Media or sent to mr. Oliver Stone, why people from
Ukraine angry and wish to die,! are they real Ukranian people or just criminals
... living in Ukraine

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

we don't kill each other and don't hate each other. We live on our God given
land and want to live in peace, but if anyone will try to take it from us we
will fight and we will kill - just any of 200 countries on the Globe. There is
no other hate but hate for our enemies capturing our land, but do you really
think we should love them?


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

What about people in Kiev, who were there ? Who killed Ukranians ... Russians
??? I feel sorry for innocent people who died ...no killing were in many other
countries for Piece and I independents ..,

Time will show the true ...

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

In Kyiv civilians were shot by militia and special forces loyal to corrupt
government of Yanukovych that was in fact supported by V. Putin.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
How do you know , it's not other agents ? Not foreign countries ...
too much hate in Ukraine, ;
Why it did not happened in other former republic of
USSR , like Baltic countries separated without killing people

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
You want to say no corruption now in Ukraine ?

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

Some of them were other agents - FSB in fact. There is much corruption even in
EU, but now in Ukraine government does not kill or arrest civilians just for
going out for a protest.

What do you know about hate, are you a hate expert, or smth that you throw
these words just like that? Can you give us all an estimate on exact hate
numbers or percentage perhaps?  @igg{fbicon.smile} 

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Number of hate ? You need another 100 or more years to change or be better
::you throw the word "kill", to kill your ex president , you voted for him, to
kill other presidents , any body who take your land, even own Ukranians who
want normal life, no war.. You don't know what you talking about to "kill", if
real war you live 30 min, me too

Think before you turn on your emotions ... Non of Ukrainian mother wants her
son fight for land at cemetery ...you ignoring the fact that Baltic countries
become independent without killing , they not far from you ...

I know many examples , real stories about people in Ukraine , don't play stupy

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

I didn't vote for him just as other tens of millions of Ukrainians. He fixed
his elections and in fact was illegal president from the start. No one wants to
kill or die but it's better to die as a free man, than live as a slave. So
don't be stupid yourself - you would have done the same thing if China or US
invaded Russia, so cut your rubbish chat about normal life. Sometimes you just
have to fight for it just like your grandpa did during WW2.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

You did not vote, other Ukrainians did ... I don't live in Russia, I live in
North America , where more then 300 hundreds nationalities live here and they
are not slaves and they are not fight and kill each other , even in your
statements too much negativity "better to die", this is your choice , people
like you ,,

make war, and get lessons from this war , unfortunately innocent people die ..,

"Play stupy" and "don't be stupy" it's different meaning ... My grandpa and
grandmo born in Ukraine ..and German soldier saved her with 2 kids from SS Army
You need another 100 years , we speak "different" language

Many statements of people who live in Ukraine are very angry , they against
Russians, same Slavic group of people, in America people get married black with
white , Asian with Caucasian , you are one of angry people and " better die"
your words ,, nobody want make you slave , slavery time were in USA, but you
support agents from USA, and don't want see the true ...

\iusr{Orest Andrijiw}

Mr. Popov. Suggest you read normal history books. Russians are not and never
been Slavs. This is fact. Unfortunately for you, your version of history is
based on old russian lies and propaganda.


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Orest you don't know me to make your statement,
you read the books ,
go back far , Kiev was a capita of old Russia

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Capital city

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Yes , language is very similar and close, but its not the main points
I hear you : people like you make war in Ukraine,
but you run away from Ukraine
Not sure if you also support Nazi

\iusr{Marusia Stashynsky}

You want the truth?! Go to Ukraine! Talk to the people!!
Listening to a corrupt killer and thief has no credibility!

\iusr{Myla Ustymenko}

Nikolai, Kyiv was a capital of Rus, not Russia. Russia was called Moskovia up
to 1721. It did not have anything to do with Kiev Rus, except the fact that
Kievan Prince Yuri Dolgoruki founded Moscow.

Also, I want to remind you that Soviet Union sided with Nazis from the
beginning of the WWII up to June 22,1941. Soviets not only sided with Nazis but
invaded Poland together, held a joint military parade, and had a joint
NKVD-Gestapo conference. Red Army supported Nazis. You admire Red Army. Does it
make you a Nazi supporter?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Myla, I did not say anything about Red Army , you do , do you support Nazi ? I
am against Nazi . Some people in Ukraine put together symbol SS and Ukrainian
flag ; you support this , they did support Hitler'ss, do you ??? It's a crime
against humanity... Be human don't send your children , if you have, to die...


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

For Myla , is this "people " in Ukraine not NAZI ? You have to live now and
believe facts, is it humans, Ukranian soldiers sent missiles to civilian
buildings , killing children and women... Do you know that . I feel you support
more Army , and again you are one of many numbers angry people, who boost the
war ..

But probably you don't have son and children who can die there , read more
books

\textbf{Nikolai popov}, I do know what the war is. The fact that new Ukr govt is not nazi along with other Moscow propaganda has been approved by UN, OSCE and other world peace organizations. The fact that Russia is ripping Ukraine apart to build a new Empire- has been proven at the level of UN General Assy. People like you support Putin's crimes against humanity.

Do you support these people? Its very immature of you trying to cling to the
same arguments that have been already proven to be false. What will you say
next? That NATO tried to make Crimea a military base and thats why Russia
occupied that place in force, while lying that its not them? Or will you say
that free people of Donbass are fighting against Nazi occupiers?

that sadly you can fool some of the people all of the time.

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}
\textbf{Nikolai Popov}, 

I really doubt you are from Canada - Canadians NEVER call their country North
America, but people pretending to do so often do, just as those who think there
is a line "nationality" in Ukrainian passport.

Where in all of my posts you've read that I hate Russians or other Slavs? Stop
thinking up what is missing. I hate those who invaded my land and brought war
and I don't care wether they are Russians or Canadians of origin. We've lived
peacefuly 23 years and there was no hatred whatsoever until putin started
messing up things when he realised he's loosing control over Ukraine, after his
puppet Yanukovych fled to his puppetmaster.

"Kiev was a capita of old Russia" There was never such a thing you call old
Russia. Kyiv was the capital of Kyevan Rus. Name Russia was first introduced
only in 18th century.

\iusr{Dave Antill}

Nikolai let's hope mr stone make a film about Mr Putin's corruption and murders
too . There is no shortage of incidents

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

For all angry people " statements, I don't want read them all, because you
don't answering my questions , you changing my words and statements, you make
your own conclusions for me, and many people like you doing that , who "fight"
for humanity in Ukraine, , for the true, for the Peace and Freedom same time
support Nazi. Nazi is Nazi , any country, I do not support any of them ! Time
will show the true, and if you want the War , your choice , you will get
lessons from the War you support, I am for Peace. No meter what I say, you will
be Angry, calling me bad names and changing my words... , put lies here

Which is proves : you don't want True , you are afraid the true. "Kill, die ,
and many many similar , these are your words , you lives with them; nonsense .
You need another 100 or more years to change, be better, you forget War 2,
short memory

драка двух посетительниц кафе "Калинка" в Луганске (18+), Frozen, youtube, 30.12.2014%
}

В Луганске возле кафе "Калинка" две девушки устроили пьяную драку. Конфликт
начался в самом кафе, но драться там девушки не стали.  За этой потасовкой
наблюдала толпа людей: посетители кафе, проходящие люди, зеваки. Наряд
патрульно-постовой службы, который видел происходящее,  не спешил разнимать
девушек а просто наблюдал за происходящим.

Разнять девушек не пришло в голову никому. Более того, нетрезвых дамочек
подстрекали к продолжению разборок, выкрикивая: "Бей кулаками" и "Пусть сдохнут
обе", снимали всё на видео и выложили в интернет. А когда одна из девушек
неожиданно сняла юбку во время потасовки, восторгу зрителей не было предела.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

I don't subscribe to this idea that Yanukovych was this super-corrupt demon. He
didn't bomb countries into the stone age to support domestic commercial
factions in the energy, arms and construction industries unlike certain states
that like to hector states on matters of "corruption". No halos for Yanu of
course but the idea that he was someway uniquely "corrupt" is hysterical.
Yanukovych's actual crime is that he actually guarded Ukrainian sovereignty and
he didn't turn his country over to Western loan sharks - so for the West, he
had to go.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Алекс Каплан}

Obviously you didn't do any kind of research on him or his family. Shortly
after he became president, his sons became basically the wealthiest people in
the country. The Corruption index rated Ukraine in the top 3 most corrupt
countries on earth in 2012. All you have to do is look at hos actions,and what
he did since the overthrow; he ran to his puppet master in Moscow; that is all
he was the entire time... Putin's Puppet. Hell he was even a convicted criminal
and spent time in jail (for theft). I dont think you quite understand what
happened. He failed to sign the EU economic deal instead signing the Russian
trade federation deal, pissing off pretty much everyone in western and central
Ukraine; the only people who stood to profit were the far east Ukrainians and
people from his home city in Donetsk who would profit from coal sales and
industry ties. He was not a Demon, he was and is however, super corrupt, among
the most in the world. He was not "guarding Ukrainian sovereignty"- that is a
joke, he was ruling Ukraine as a proxy for Putin who was pretending it was a
Faux soviet Union nation state.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

I don't care about "corruption indexes", tables, breakdown charts, or any of
the other jibberish interference mass produced by globalist organs in order to
maul a man who's real crime in the West's eyes was to protect Ukrainian
sovereignty. Real corruption is represented by the Atlantic bloc who have set
the world on fire in pursuit of petty commercial goals. Yanukovych is a
benevolent character in comparison.

\iusr{Andre Maurer}

What John is saying, I think, is that yes he was corrupt, but he is far from
the only corrupt politician. We can cite examples of Dick Cheney's Haliburton
getting billions of dollars in contracts from the Iraqi war which Cheney
himself started.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

Technocratic corruption indexes doesn't detect the war profiteering Bush
family, it doesn't detect the billionaire Queen of Britain awarding her
offspring enormous wealth from state coffers on terms of inheritance, it
doesn't detect the corruption of malicious vampires setting the world on fire
putting millions into misery. Technocratic indexes doesn't detect that kind of
extreme moral corruption at all. I don't like either - but old style corruption
seems like a blessing compared to rioting planetary pyromaniacs like goggle
eyed Clintoon and John McCrazy.

\iusr{Dianne Witiuk}
Yanukovych is a potato farmer who sold his soul to the devil incarnate.

\iusr{Myron Pyzyk}

Everybody, please. Ukraine doesn't care if Yanuk. wins the boobie prize as the
most corrupt President. You must be sitting on a comfortable couch outside of
Ukraine to make that opinion as well as not having any family there. Yanuk was
a corrupt President and UKRAINIANS in Ukraine were fed up. Really fed up. The
previous generation was still Soviet-trained to shut the hell up and take it on
the chin or even die in a gulag. Stoic people but sheep. The new generation of
Ukrainian kids were born in Ukraine or, at the very least, grew up in a very
young nation with a long history called Ukraine. Proud they didn't take any
more BS. Poroshenko et al better move fast otherwise, Deja vu.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

@Myron Pyzyk: "Fed up" yes, they were for sure. But that's why the new regime
prohibited Russian language as second state language? Or thats why all Russian
channels were closed in Ukraine right after Poroshenko elections? That's why
they bombed Donbass? Now about "previous generation" and "long history of
Ukraine". Ukraine in Russian means "U Kraya" and is spelled like "At The
Edge/Periphery". It's former Russian Empire periphery territory and Kiev city
is the origin of Russian Orthodox Cristian Church and maybe the whole Russian
and Slavonic history.... Ukraine was 500 years the Russian Empire land and
Ukrainians and Russians were one united brother folk. Ukraine ( Zaporoskaya
Sech) asked Russian Empire to protect its people from polish "panov" who gang
banged them back in centuries... So trying to deprive Ukraine from Russia and
divide one folk into two and more of this to flame the hostage between them
(saying like old soviet generation and new generation or long history of

not to allow the NATO to expand near Russian borders, make transit of gas
smooth, predictable, safe, transparent and yes controlled, to have friendly and
close and trustworthy relations with neighbors and brother nations like
Ukrainians and Belorussians who mostly speak the same and one Russian language
and have more than 500 years of one history....

Ukraine had a series of extraordinarily corrupt governments. Both pro-Western
and pro-Russian. Timoshenko could go mile-per-mile against Yanukovich any day -
the Gas Princesse become a billionaire stealing gas, and is widely believed to
have eliminated numerous competitors with extreme prejudice. None of this
justifies a foreign sponsored coup d'etat which has torn the country to shreds.

Yanukovich's transgressions aren't a big deal when confronted with the
collection of toads, gargoyles, "foreign citizens", robber-barons, vampires
that are happy to launch airstrikes against civilian districts and have
pampered vampire-clowns such as "Joe Biden"and John McCrazy cheering them on.
We need to get our head around this idea. Raging from dawn to dusk against
Yanukovich like he's lucifer 2.0 whilst shrugging our shoulders at the jackals
laying waste to one half of Ukraine and robbin' the rest is like ragin' against
a prolific shoplifter whilst apologisin' for the local serial killer./arsonist

Again, Mr. Stone, I suggest you get the TRUTH from a UKRAINIAN professor at
Harvard who knows the true history not from a gangster!! Research Yanukovych's
past!! It is way easy to put a spin on even history these days!!! Hollywood
does it magnificently! Russia has used Ukraine, raped her of her treasures, and
starved her people in the famine of 1913. Movies and documentaries have been
made about the Jewish Holocaust, but why not educate about the Ukrainian
Holocaust and get the truth out about that? Ukrainian history has been trampled
on and distorted by Russia for generations. They even took credit for and
celebrated 1,000 years of Christianity, when in fact it was Ukraine who
accepted Christianity and disseminated to Russian and other countries and that
is just the tip of misinformation. Yanukovych is NOT a resource for ANYTHING!!
He is a Russian puppet!

\iusr{Vincenzo Lachimera}

Ukraine is the motherland of all Russia. From Kaliningrad to Kamchatka
Ukrainian surnames populate every city and village. Kiev is the mother of all
Russian cities and the Kievan RUS are the mother of all Russian people.
Ukrainians are Russians, the ones promoting the idea that they are a separate
people are from the west of modern Ukraine which was Poland and Lithuania
formerly. There was no famine in 1913, there was famine in 1931-32 and millions
died all across Russia from this famine. There were many reasons for the high
death toll, partly because Stalin had murdered all the best farm managers as
Kulaki, my German Mennonite ancestors among them, and to a lesser degree the
indifference of bureaucrats in Moscow and Kiev. Millions also died on the
Indian sub-continent fromthe same famine. Ukrainian history is Russian history,
the eastward march of Muscovy was a continuation of the north eastward march of
Kievan Rus! I would not be so impressed with Harvard professors, graduate
students at Harvard are no better at geography than the set decorators that
work at CNN! Lastly, Ukraine is a Russian word, it means borderland, borderland
of the Kievan Rus, who dwell in the modern great nation of Russia that all the
ancestors of the true Ukrainian people pioneered and created!!!

The problem is in case, that many of you can't truly catch the definition
between "russians" which are dwelling in Russia now or Grand Duchy of Moscow in
the past (the population of 146 millions) and "rus'ki" or "rusin" or "rusnak"
which are dwelling on theirs roots own lands that were compound in one Kievan
Rus' empire (included: Ukraine 46 mln, Belarus = 9.5 mln and just a small part
of nowadays Russia territory). Its a big trick of history that russians use all
the time, just replacing the definitions.

One more important point. I think you're confusing a nationalist with a Nazi. A
nationalist does not hate other nations. A nationalist simply loves his own.
But when another (neighboring) nation does everything possible to erase any
traces of his/her cultural and linguistic national identity in order to
subjugate and ultimately absorb his/her people, what's a nationalist to do but
fight?

But speaking specifically about the Nachtigall unit the accusations of the
atrocities have since been proven FALSE by the international commission at The
Hague. The conclusion reads: "After four months of inquiries and the evaluation
of 232 statements by witnesses from all circles involved, it can be established
that the accusations against the Battalion Nachtigall and against the then
Lieutenant and currently Federal Minister Oberländer have no foundation in
fact". It was just a Soviet attempt to discredit the nationalist movement in
Ukraine as well as the German government in the late 50's.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Valentine Azbelle}

Wrestler Joe: Of course we could have a debate about the intricacies of the
Polish-Ukrainian relations that led to the tragedy, and we could discuss the
atrocities committed by the Red Army (and in particular the atrocities the
Soviet NKVD committed against the poles AND the Ukrainians), as well as look
into the number of the torchlit marches participants (which is quite small), or
the nature of the collaboration of their hero with the Nazis, or even abstract
concepts like symbolism vs. a real person... But sorry, I don't see a point of
having a debate with someone expressing an outrage over terrorizing civilians

Your words were "Kadyrov... he's a real man". Sounds like a high praise to me

man, and was in fact not a woman pretending to be a man, but a real man). Also
Kadyrov is among your FB likes.

I don't know who decided that Russians aren't Slavs. But I do know that "your
boys" (whatever that means) decided that Ukrainians aren't even a nation. I'm
all about all of humanity but if one particular part of humanity attacks
another, it is absolutely the right of the attacked humanity to tell the

\textbf{Oliver Stone} Спасибо за правду.

\iusr{Carol Green}

Thank you Oliver Stone for speaking truth. I've followed this story closely
from the original unrest in Kyiv and there's never been any doubt the U.S. has
been behind the coup that has caused the deaths of over 4,000 innocent
Ukrainians.

Historically, since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Crimea
has NEVER wanted to be a part of Ukraine... EVER... and in every election they
chose Crimean leaders who would distance them from Ukraine.

• Like it or not, the majority of Crimeans never wanted any relationship with
Ukraine whatsoever. The history proves this.

• Like it or not, the majority of Crimeans wanted closer relations with Russia
and in 1995 voted for a president whose platform was to have Crimea join the
Russian Federation. The history proves this.

The Historical Record shows that Crimeans have overwhelmingly objected to the
Kiev appointed Executive Branch that has been forced upon them for over two
decades.

2,000,000 citizens in Crimea

1995: 73\% of Crimeans voted for pro-Russian president whose platform in the
Crimean elections was to join Russia.

Say 100\% of people voted.

73\% of 2000000 == 1,460,000 people voted for joining Russia.

2014: 93\% voted to secede and join Russia.

And this is with 83\% of the Crimean people voting.

83\% of 2,000,000 == 1,660,000 people voted

93\% of 1,660,000 == 1,543,800 people voted for joining Russia

1,543,800 – 1,460,000 == 83,800 changed their minds?

Percent of total population that changed their minds: 83,800 / 2,000,000 == .04\%

Here's more Crimean voting results since the dissolution of the Soviet Union
that shows the tug of war between the people of Crimea who desperately wanted
independence from Ukraine and overwhelmingly voted for that independence
throughout the years and the Ukrainian central government :

Still, you made Yanukovich look like a victim. Before airing the interview, you

his predecessors) gifted to the country. Then with the two different points of
view, you'd look fairer and balanced. Yanukovich is the most hideous and hated
person in the country, with his golden bread and toilets, and with the 27 bln
USD stolen to the country. Why you didn't ask him about that? Why you spoke to
him like to a person? Have you studied his history before? Have you seen the

The root of legends about hatred of western Ukrainan to Russians such as

killed thousands of native citizens. Do you really think it's not enough reason
for hatred.

But it has nothing to do with modern times, lots of Russians are in western
Ukraine becoz of soviet policy of assimilation population. Those Russians are

Mr. Stone I have only one question: When putin's lie will totaly destroyed, you
will go to International Court of Justice to pay for you personal lie or you
will hide from justice like meny nazi do after the World War in 1945 ?

\begin{itemize} % {

Real nazi are not hide in Kremlin. They did meny of things like Hitler and
Goebbels did 75 years ago. In propaganda Kremlin elders even exceeded their
predecessors. And it is very big misfortune for Russia because russian citizens
will pay for what their "elite" did already.

\iusr{Lyudmyla Yankina}

I am sorry dear Oliver, but you are even do not emagine how much you have wrong
point of view. Ukraine is the country, which was suffer from yanukovych and
kremlin many years. And after many millions people just do not want suffer any
more cause in the eng we have our dignity. So we stand off against corruption,
criminals in law and politics who do not know what is human rights. You are
seems like a smurt person but your realasing based on a pictures (?!) and nice
conversatind with kremlin person (?!) that's it? you didn't make any deep
analizing of the situation in general from the inside. You didn't spoke with
any victim or participant of the revolution or war. 

Your point of view is not objective and not deep. Should I ask you how much
cremlin pay for this? Should I asl will you have somw matelial advantages from
it? Because only like this I can understand why you did it. If you like to not
be ashamed in the books of the history on the future - speak with us? with real
participants of the situation, that you name nazi. 

Don't be affraide, we will not drink your blood and kill you. In reality - we
are very peaceful people with high level of culture and dignity. 

We can tell you everything and it will be very big case for your movie because
we are many people and each have own reason to be a revolutioneer and stand off
against yanukovych-putin regime. Most of us very good educated people and we
are able to give you the base for objectivnes.  Speak with us - real people,
ask us, do not ashame yourselve. You will find all real unswers for all your
"picture" questions. 

We are not nazi! Ukrainian - it is a nation of dignity, not of violance! But
saddnly we should defend ourselves many years and exactly the last year from
the violance, propaganga and artifisual dirt - on what you base your point of
view about us. Very painfully mr. Stone. 

Do not turn history upside down just because you are not able to work well with
historical material, which is still in the making, exactly when millions of
participants of the history alive and many of them right now dying on the war
from russian weapon.

Mr. Stone, I've always been a fan of your talent but now I am ashamed of you.
It's indecent to speak about things you have no idea about and claim things you
haven't witnessed. It's a shame to be a tool of Russian propaganda. People of
Ukraine overthrew Yanukovich because they were tired of his crimes. We will do
the same with the present President if he doesn't do what he should do for the
country. Some commenters praised your bravery. It's not brave to say something
you have no idea about, it's arrogant. I live in Donetsk region which produced
Yanukovich but I am for the new Ukraine and so are many people around. Stop
seeing the hand of CIA everywhere! What about the people who live here? Don't
they mean anything? Don't they have the right to choose how they want to live?

\begin{itemize} % {

You can try and attach any conspiracy you "see" is connected to the events on
Maidan. The truth is much simpler - about 300 students started the protest due
to president's refusal to follow his promises to associate with EU. Those
students were dispersed and beaten. This brought outrage and thousands people
to the streets, they wanted this to be investigated and the guilty punished.
But the beatings persisted and even more police force arrived. This brought
even more people onto the streets, this time demanding president's resignation
due to him failing in his duties to the people - they simply had enough of this
BS. But wait, you see CIA in this. I bet all 300 students were paid off. I bet
the president was paid off by CIA too, he had to escalate the situation just
right and keep pushing for people to rise up. But there is more, there were
about 300 students protesting, right? It must mean that Sparta had its hand in
it too! Everybody knows Sparta fights in squads of 300. Yes, that must be it!
Good job.

To Oliver Stone ( Second letter )

Mr. Stone, please try to focus in that Ukrainians want to be the authors of
their own destiny.

You said: "The big picture is the US has never given up on using Ukraine as a
launching pad to the underbelly of the Soviet Union".

And what about the attitude of Soviet Union (now Russia) with Ukraine, do you
remember the Holodomor?, do you remember the russian scum that is killing and
destroying the lives of hundred of civilians in the East of Ukraine.?

Mr. Stone the big picture is: Ukraine had the president and government most
corrupt. And when Ukrainians wanted to change all that, the russians jumped
into the jugular.

Forget to the Ukrainians please, and let they find solutions his problems.

Maybe you can continue doing good movies, maybe about Maduro or Chavez or about
how venezuelans lost his rights and live under poverty thresholds.

For the moment people in Ukraine don't want to know about you.

Best regards!!

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Lisa Marie White}

They're a US colony know so I hope they enjoy their "independence." East of
Ukraine in Holodomar, you say? Yes, because it was only Ukrainian speaking
Ukrainians who died in that famine? Forget the starvation deaths in Moscow, and
the 1 million who died during the same famine in Siberia. What about the Poles,
Germans, Roma, Tatar, and ethnic Russians who died as a result of that famine?
It was not a genocide against Ukrainians. It was the result of failed
collectivization programs put in place by Stalin. Way to deflect from Ukraine's
alliance with Hitler and their involvement in the Holocaust. Drinking that
Bandera kool-aid, are we? Chavez was a good leader and he stood up to the West,
too. The US overthrew him, demonized him, and his people rose up and put him
back into power. Yanukovych may have been corrupt, but they were going to have
elections to vote him out. Ukraine has been in charge of its destiny for 23
years, and what does it have to show for itself except bankruptcy and extremist
nationalism? Venezuela is rising out of the ashes of the US trying to control
and impoverish their nation. You don't speak for everyone who lives in Ukraine
or anywhere else. There are people there in the East now and they know who is
using illegal cluster bombs on them an they know it is Poroshenko. Here's a
picture of your friends, with their hero, the Nazi collaborator and war
criminal Bandera.

Totally agree... I lived half of my life in Canada and went to visit my friends

Naturally I've been very well" prepped" by the Western media and sincerely
wanted to be with my friends during the time of the "revolution"... "Revolution
my a. s", were some of the responses! I stayed around , went to Kiev , took pics
and just could NOT believe what was happening and more importantly how the so
called "free and independent" were reporting on the events.. or rather not
reporting on many of them. Yours was one of the few voices of wisdom that are
barely coming through! Kudos!


\iusr{Kobus Johannes}

Oliver Stone, you are 100\% correct. I’ve been to Ukraine and met people who
accepted Western bribes as protestors for Maiden, another false color
revolution serving Western interests only. It must be known that the vast
majority of Donbas people (E. Ukrainians) are local Russian speaking Ukrainian
residents who identify themselves as Ukrainians, not Russians from mother
Russia. No foreign invasion by mother Russia has ever occurred. Images of
Russian tanks are Western forgeries from a previous war in South Ossetia.

\enquote{Russian insurgents or Russian terrorists} are Western propaganda and lies,
cleverly used words used to stereotype the local Russian speaking Ukrainian
population and to create anti-Russia hysteria. These locals are only defending
their own economic interests. Their only crime is that they refused to subject
themselves to a new U.S. fascist installed government whose aim is to impose
upon them the same European style austerity, a form of economic slavery. This
same formula has been applied to many nations. 

The U.S., EU, IMF, World bank,
etc. who operates under the umbrella of an international banking mafia is
responsible for instigating for-profit false wars, false revolutions in order
to install puppet regimes in countries. 

The new puppet leaders facilitate in bankrupting their nation by accepting an
IMF \enquote{poison pill loan}, thereby guaranteeing a near collapse, forcing
further dependency on the IMF. These new creditors (hyenas) now move in for the
kill to rape, pillage, loot and take control of that country’s resources. 

While the puppets and oligarchs fill their coffers, the people pay a heavy
price through an IMF re-structuring program known as \enquote{austerity}. It is
manifested in many ways, e.g. hyper inflation, 50\% reduction in pension,
devaluation of banking assets, raising of gas prices, reduction in salaries,
creating mass unemployment and unsustainable economy turning people into
beggars. This has been the main cause and reason for mass riots in many EU
nations. 

Greece and Iceland are good examples of economies that have been ravaged by
these western thieves and pirates. Greece finally decided to draw the line and
take back control of their nation and we see how quickly Iceland has recovered
after expelling these corrupt banksters.

Most Ukrainian politicians and oligarchs have been bribed and bought by western
powers for years who then siphon off and sold cheaply to the West the wealth,
resources and labor of the Ukrainian people. This is why the Ukrainian economy
has been kept in a state of stupor and no progress, and the reason why people
remain impoverished. The median monthly salary for people in Ukraine is between
\$80 - \$300 USD. How do they survive on this? They just live together with
parents in tiny apartments. 

In every country the U.S. is involved there is
division, war, death, chaos and economic bankruptcy and only the American
people benefit. In Ukraine I can live like a rich man with my US dollars. 

The people of Donbas simply refused the newly U.S. installed puppet leaders
from imposing the same economic medicine to their regions. This is why their
cities and population center became the target of ethnic cleansing through
daily bombarded by Kiev with grad rockets, prosperous bombs and other
international banned weapons... all directed and orchestrated by Washington. 

America MUST head a recent warning issued by Putin \enquote{The spring can only
be stretched so far before it snaps back}. It is time to wake up and realize
who are the enemies of mankind. It is not Islam, ISIS or some other terrorist
insurgency which is a creation by the U.S. and those that control it. Lets not
forget that the United States is not a country or a nation, it is a Federal
corporation 28 USC § 3002 (15)(A). Corporations is what runs the world. This is
the true face of fascism.

\iusr{Robert Drake}

\enquote{...and although many (perhaps a majority) wanted him out....} Time to head for
Crimea Ollie, go in depth, or get shot or arrested trying... perhaps you would
prefer we did NOT help these people? It was an anti-criminal revolution, and if
you want to challenge the corruption and oligarchy that exists in the USA...

Oliver, thank you very much for giving the view of the true picture of what
happened in Ukraine during Maidan and what is happening now.. It requires a
great courage to dig out and show the truth. The same way as you did with your
great film about JFK. Ukraine has a long story of corruption, this is true, but
it hasn't started and hasn't ended on Yanukovich. And what is true is that he
hasn't sent one part of his nation against another part, this is done by
pro-Western goverment now just in order to weaken Russia. By the way, Ukraine
now has the Ministry of censorship, that is trying to close second biggest
Ukrainian TV chanel "Inter" for them showing Russian and Ukrainian singers,
that also perform in Russia during New Year Night program. Do they have such
ministry in Russia? No. Somewhere else? Espresso TV channel also had a problem
with this ministry. This is a "Democracy" and "Democratic power", that is
founded in Ukraine as a result of "Revolution of Spirit", but indeed is a
victory of brain washing media, intellegence and people, who are too lazy to
think and have an indepedent mind. Thank you!

\iusr{Nataliya Bodnar}

Have you visited Ukraine? Have you talked to people in Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa? Or
you are only showing your story from one point of view? Do you really think

sacrifing their lives have you sat down with? What about the leaders of Maidan?
You're not brave for putting this misinformation out there as some other
Putinites have commented, you're negligent and sloppy in your information
gathering which, coming from someone with your background can only mean you're

I understand that you have bills to pay but it's a shame that you chose to
accept such a lowly way of making a buck. Perhaps it would be much better
solution to sell you properties in the US and moving to one of the countries
that you defend at such a great length- russia or venezuela.

Who cares if the CIA , MI5 or even Mossad were involved to overthrow
Yanukovitch's corrupt Kremlin backed government. The most important outcome was
that Ukraine has rid itself of the 'cancer' implanted by previous Soviet
governments and in turn has helped the civilized world rid itself of Kremlin
involvement.

In the last elections, the ultra far-right Ukrainian parties received less than
5\% vote, one of the lowest showing in the entire Europe ( 25\% France anyone?)
yet Russia, with its highest concentration of Neo Nazis in the entire world,
continues to barrage and troll the media that Ukrainians are nazi thugs.
Perhaps, Mr. Stone, next time you're there, you should ask why Mr. Putin openly
funds France's ultra-nationalistic Front National.


\iusr{Lida Zinko}

Your other comment that Ukrainians murdered Jews, Soviets and Poles in 1941 is
hateful and has no place here. I am not going to argue this, although you
should read some alternative history not written by the Soviet Russia. However
with this comment you're actually asking the reader to infer that Ukrainians
are ultra-nationalistic Nazi thugs without actually making this statement, as
you know very well that it's hateful. Just keep this in mind, Russians took
over Crimea and Eastern Ukraine in order to " protect their own ethnic
Russians" ( who are actually Ukrainians citzens) - isn't it the ultimate in the
tribalism and ultra nationalism.

Ukraine was a very divided country. The election for president was close but
Yanukovich won the vote. Just before the coup polling showed that only 45\% of
Ukrainians supported Maidan protests. That happens to be exactly the percentage
that voted against Yanukovich. Majority of Ukrainians opposed Maidan. So the
people who lost the election just seized power by force.

It is indeed before the sniper from the building occupied by Right Sector

support the Maidan message so the coup organizers had to resort to violence.
But first murder was committed by Maidan protesters when they stormed the Party
of Regions offices and murdered an employee there.

Москаль рассказал, чьи снайперы стреляли на Майдане, pravda.com.ua, 07.03.2014%
}

\begin{multicols}{2}
В участников протестов на Майдане и милиционеров стреляли снайперы МВД и СБУ, а
не какие-то иностранцы.

Об этом заявил нардеп Геннадий Москаль в интервью "Зеркалу недели".

Москаль, который обнародовал планы операций по зачистке Майдана, заявил, что
офис Партии регионов сожгли переодетые работники СБУ.

"Проведению обеих спецопераций предшествовала специальная подготовка.
Переодетые работники СБУ под видом митингующих, к которым присоединились и
настоящие участники акций протеста, подожгли офис Партии регионов, в результате
чего погибли два человека", - заявил Москаль.

"Вместе с этим снайперы получили указание расстреливать не только протестующих,
но и милиционеров. Все делалось для эскалации конфликта, чтобы оправдать
силовую зачистку Евромайдана", - заявил Москаль.

Он напомнил, что сразу после этого появились гневные призывы к президенту от
областных советов Востока, Юга и Крыма с требованиями принять решительные меры.

"То есть эти вещи были взаимосвязаны и четко спланированы", - считает Москаль.

Он заявляет, что использование снайперов предполагалось спецоперациями "Волна"
и "Бумеранг".

"Было несколько групп снайперов - из СБУ ("Альфа") и МВД (спецподразделения
внутренних войск плюс "Сокол")", - заявил Москаль.

Он убеждает, что приказать стрелять подразделениям МВД мог только экс-министр
Виталий Захарченко, а "Альфе" - экс-руководитель СБУ Александр Якименко.

Информацию о "третьей стороне", которая отдавала приказы снайперам, Москаль
называет попыткой нового руководства МВД и СБУ "заработать авторитет" и
отбелить силовиков.

"В обнародованных мной документах... названы снайперские группы конкретных
украинских спецподразделений. Там же указаны их точки дислокации, фамилии
ответственных, позывные снайперов", - напоминает Москаль.

Он не понимает, "как туда могли затесаться какие-то иностранцы? Какая "третья
сила" приснилась Авакову с Наливайченко?"

Как известно, новый глава МВД Арсен Аваков заявлял, что действий снайперов в
Киеве причастна некая "третья сила".

Trade Union House (previously headquarter of uprising) was cleared from rebels
and burnt down. There was not a single rebel inside Zhovtnevy palace too. All

Agree with you 110\% on this one. Good job Mr. Oliver Stone!

\iusr{Van Huebner}

Seems to me there's a lot of logical fallacy at work with regard to who is to
blame \& who to trust on the topic of the Ukraine crisis.

For example, wanting democracy or independence from either America or Russia
isn't a bad desire - that is, unless what you plan to do as a democracy
includes the same abandonment of all consideration for the environment ( such
as frack and destroy arable land and ground water forever ), or the fate of
communities that that wish to preserve local control of the agrarian methods
(bioregionally appropriate yield) versus allowing The West (including both gov
\& NGOs of the EU - including Israel btw) as a tool of Agribusinesses such as
Monsanto to basically steal the small farm for an ailing global marketplace (
ie, increased profit for the more powerful producers of consumable goods and
technology which btw is dependent upon the very inscrutable manipulation of
public information through, yes, logical fallacies!)

So, the question becomes both who has what to gain and how do each of the
protagonists propose to go about establishing and maintaining their goal when
examining such issues as the fate of this territory. I propose that as long as
one purports to be talking about Nationhood, a listener should recognize a
deeper fundamental issue at stake: the very use and abuse of land and
communities more in touch with the soil. This indeed makes the Ukraine a
greater focal point for discussion regarding "who's to blame" for the
despoliation of arable land versus who is getting in the way of the expansion
of Global Industry and its appropriation of wealth by profiting from the
natural resources in the territories of yet to be manipulated others.

No ordinary person knows who really shot down people on Maidan from the roofs
but the fact is that under Yanu the corruption was unlimited and they would
falsify all new elections ,court decisions as is done in Crimea and Donbass.
Yanukovitsj is not the person to ask who it was he sold people to Moscow . The
big protest on Maidan is not because of the not signing of the eu contract but
the fact that Berkut officers hit and shoot down students .(that was to see by
people) That was the sign for the people of Ukraine to stop the regime of
corruption and violence . For sure CIA was there as the KGB and others were in
Kiev at that moment .

\iusr{Yuri Panchul}

The war in Ukraine is actually a sort of religious war, and the religion in
question is called "Democracy Promotion". Here is a quote from Michael McFaul,
a formet Ambassador of the United States in Russia:

\href{http://panchul.livejournal.com/316473.html}{%
Макфол для чайников / McFaul for Dummies, panchul.livejournal.com, 12.12.2013%
}

Quote from Michael McFaul: These state-to-state relationships helped to
dissuade Kuchma and Shevardnadze from cracking down on their opposition
movements and also facilitated the work of American non-governmental
organizations, which worked with civil society and opposition groups inside
both countries.

Quote from Michael McFaul: In the fall of 2003, numerous American envoys tried
to convince President Shevardnadze to hold free and fair elections. When he did
not, the Bush administration did not immediately denounce the election results,
but gradually signaled support for the opposition until they seized power. In
the run up to the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, Bush administration officials
also encouraged President Kuchma to hold free and fair elections, and by
denying visas to prominent Ukrainian businessmen, signaled to the regime the
consequences of a fraudulent vote. These threats did not prevent Kuchma from
trying to steal the vote, but they may have helped to constrain the president
and his entourage from using force against the demonstrators. Indirectly,
American-supported media outlets’ reports on Kuchma’s involvement in the
killing of Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze and the vast corruption of
Shevardnadze’s Georgian government also helped to undermine the popularity and
power of these leaders.

Quote from Michael McFaul: NDI and IRI played active roles in encouraging
cooperation among the democratic groups in Serbia and Ukraine, though less so
in Georgia. They did so by collecting and then sharing survey data, which
underscored the electoral advantage of a single candidate. In both countries,
this data pointed to the need to back particular candidates — Voijislav Kostunica
in Serbia and Viktor Yushchenko in Ukraine rather than the more charismatic
opposition leaders in both countries at the time (Zoran Djinjic in Serbia and
Yulia Timoshenko in Ukraine).

While there is little doubt that the US State Dept. did have some role in
supporting Ukranians in overthrowing their leader, they didn't do so in a
vacuum.

You have to keep in mind that their Parliament - including many who were
previous supporters of Yanukovich - voted overwhelmingly for his removal from
office. By your own admission, the people of Ukraine wanted this to happen, and
he has no mandate to rule.

I also find it rather disturbing that you cite an RT article - RT being
controlled by the Russian government, which in turn cites an article by the
Russian government owned Rossiya segodnya - known in the West as Sputnik
International - about how the US wants to contain Russia.

Gee, Ollie. I wonder why. Furthermore, I wonder why all the Baltic nations,
Germany, the former Soviet nations, etc. have overwhelmingly supported
sanctions and closer ties with NATO. They're scared of Putin and the Russians,
Mr. Stone. They are afraid of invasion, just as they are afraid of having their
gas cut off in the middle of winter, being extorted by the Russians for
concessions, etc.

The best thing for all of these nations is to strengthen ties with Europe and
find ways to be less reliant on Russia and more open to the free market, as
opposed to being extorted back in to the former Soviet sphere - with Russians
basically centralizing and monopolizing the distribution of such a cartel.
Russia's idea of an economic union is little different than the kind of
mercantilism, imperialism, and exploitation that the US rose up against in
gaining its independence. I personally have few qualms when our government
prefers not seeing that happen again, elsewhere.

You don't seem to acknowledge that Ukraine had the Crimea seized by Russia -
with actual Russian ground troops, though Putin initially lied about it -
because Ukraine might've wanted a better deal for providing Russia with a key
naval base on the Black Sea. Somehow, it's horrible that American diplomats
sided with the Ukrainian people in overthrowing their dictator - the so-called
"president" you suggest as being legitimate, despite arresting the opposition
leader. That's awful... but sending ground troops into a sovereign nation by
Russia is okay?!

I'm not saying that you should completely dismiss the information you have
received... and there is a story there about what American people don't know
about how some former neocons were giddy as hell with the Ukranian uprising -
not that they really played kingmaker in the whole affair - but you seem
absolutely determined not to have a balanced perspective on the matter, Mr.
Stone. Instead, you seem determined to interview and seek advice from those who
are least likely to offer an unbiased perspective.

Obviously, this is a complex situation... and by no means are US hands entirely
clean... but your lack of balance in the quest for a pre-ordained story just
makes you a well-informed, entertaining... but ultimately naive... dupe. And
this is unfortunate, because your work would be better - and potentially more
damning, tragic, and complex - if your work had more dimensions to it.

That is ever so intriguing why people do things they do. In your case, Mr.
Stone, the most likely motivation would be either money – pure and simple; or
striving to be anti-mainstream, unique, avant-garde.

If you are after Cremlin’s paycheck – this is understandable indeed, but not
too likely your major motivation. Easy deal – Lord of the nuclear button’s
thirty pieces of silver would be generous enough to make you forget about
dilemmas like choosing the color of your next yacht – you can have them in each
color of the rainbow spectrum. But again – not too likely this is your sole
motivation. More probably – you share the same human weakness, that Mr.Putin
has – both of you, having reached some major accomplishments in your social
status and careers on a global level - are now trying to instill your heritage
into the times to come – for future generations. Mr. Putin has the ambition to
go down in history books as a great re-unitor of russian lands –whatever it
might mean in his sick brain. You wanna make sure you stand out from the
mainstream opinion, crowd mass thinking – you aim to be different at any cost –
having this clairvoyant whistleblowers status.

Mr. Putin will sure go down history books as a paranoid obsessive tyrant
imperialist and a lousy manager of a huge country with massive potential. How
you go down for centuries to come is yet to be defined. Or, more precisely – it
can be re-directed towards the more positive image still. Or remain as is now -
a Hollywood director with ambition to create history, not just direct very
roughly called historical movies – that he parlously failed.

Whichever motivation it is – please remember, Mr. Stone – Ukraine is still
paying a huge price for it. Have some respect. There’s blood on those crispy
notes. There's blood on your reputation now too.

high jack the revolution in order to achieve its own geopolitical goals. And if
you analyze the situation carefully, tell me how Poroshenko is different from
Yanukovitch? Is he not part of the same gang who has been plundering Ukraine
for the last 20 years? Everybody in Ukraine knows that all Ukrainian oligarchs
have become oligarchs illegally. While ordinary people were dreaming of
becoming prosperous and free and part of Europe, they were amassing their
fabulous fortunes stealing everything that had been done by the previous soviet
generations, and on top of that treating their own people as cattle. Why is
nobody talking about that? Or maybe everybody wants to become an oligarch just
like Poroshenko?

\iusr{Paul Reader}

Just some facts....Ukraine nationalists collaborated with
the Nazi’s during WWII, they even had their own SS Division (SS Galacia).
The Crimea was Russian territory won back from the Ottoman
Empire in the late 1800’s and given to the Ukraine as a protectorate by Khrushchev in the 1950’s.
The Crimea is Russia’s only warm sea port and NATO wants
them out.

America supposedly has the freedom of Ukraine as an agenda,
but America has CSG coming out of it’s ears and they would welcome the European market share that Russia currently has.
Vice President Joe Biden's son and a close friend of Secretary of State John Kerry's stepson have joined the board of the leading Ukrainian gas producer............ why?........... to save the people from Russian aggression or to grab more filthy money for the few that govern the wealth of the globe?............

Oliver is correct about events in the Ukraine. Yanukovych is no saint. He was
corrupt. But the US toppled him because he would not do their bidding, and the
US backed a bunch of Nazi thugs to do so. Pepe Escobar, as Oliver suggests, is
the best journalist covering these Ukrainian and Eurasian events. And here is
another informative report from Casey Research, a conservative financial
research firm:

Several cities in Donbas, the eastern portion of Ukraine comprising the regions
of Donetsk and Luhansk, have been embroiled in Russian-sponsored secessionist
violence against Ukrainian authorities since early April 2014. And while Russia
has no officially identified uniformed troops in the region, there are claims
that it has been involved in the fighting through the deployment of irregulars,
like the Chechen Vostok battalion (see EDM, May 30). Other irregular forces
have also been involved, such as hardline Russian nationalists. 

Now it appears there are connections to the most extreme nationalists, Russia’s
neo-Nazi movement. Posting on Facebook, Alexander Belov, the leader of the
banned Movement Against Illegal Immigration (known by its Russian acronym
DPNI), announced the death in Donetsk of Sergei Vorotsev. Vorotsev was a former
organizer for the DPNI in the Moscow Region town of Korolev (Official Facebook
page of DPNI, June 4). According to the same posting, Vorotsev was killed in
the battle for the Donetsk airport.

The presence of a former member of the DPNI in eastern Ukraine is not entirely
surprising, but it does suggest a merging of the goals of such movements and of
the Russian regime. Similarly, other neo-Nazi groups have also tried to become
involved in the Ukrainian crisis, with the group \enquote{Sputnik and Pogrom}
organizing humanitarian aid for those ethnic Russians affected by the fighting
in the region. A banner bearing the slogan \enquote{Donbas says thank you} was posted
on their site to thank all those who had donated financial aid
(sputnikipogrom.com). On another neo-Nazi website (officially banned in Russia
but purportedly hosted on servers in the United States to prevent closure by
the Kremlin), that of the skinhead gang \enquote{Slavyansky Soyuz} (Slavic Union),
there is a call for Russia to start arming the separatists or even to provide
more substantial aid due to the disproportionate array of forces deployed
against them by the government in Kyiv

(\href{http://www.demushkin.com/content/news/222/8964.html}{demushkin.com link}). 

Finally, an individual
from the \enquote{Russkiye} ethno-political movement, which grew out of the 2011
protests against United Russia and the reelection of President Vladimir Putin
(and whose membership overlaps with many other neo-Nazi gangs), expressed
condolences on May 18 to the families of those killed in the fighting in
Donbas, saying that \enquote{we must prepare ourselves for new victims}

(http://www.dpni.org/articles/vazhnoe/39003/).

It also seems that the extreme nationalists have renounced their position in
the Russian political opposition movement. Illustratively, the calls by some
nationalists for a \enquote{new Manezh} (street protest) against Putin on May 18 were
dismissed by most Far Right leaders as a provocation
(\href{http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/publications/2014/06/d29635/}{%
Расизм и ксенофобия. Итоги мая 2014 года, www.sova-center.ru, 02.06.2014%
}).

This evidence strongly suggests, therefore, the Kremlin has now co-opted the
neo-Nazi movement.

Nevertheless, the Russian Far Right’s involvement in Donbas has consequences
for the unity of other irregular forces who are supporting the separatists in
eastern Ukraine. Specifically, not all the Russian neo-Nazis were happy with
the prospect of working with other elements—especially the Chechens—in the
fight for eastern Ukraine. On DPNI leader Belov’s Facebook page, for instance,
there were comments, presumably from other neo-Nazis, deriding the involvement
of the Chechens. Indeed, Belov himself posted commentary on the DPNI website
complaining that Chechens were in Donbas \enquote{with [Chechen leader Ramzan]
Kadyrov’s blessing and for money} and not out of reasons of patriotism or
ethnic belonging (\href{http://www.dpni.org/articles/novostnaya/39200/}{%
АЛЕКСАНДР БЕЛОВ: ЧЕЧЕНЦЫ В ДОНЕЦК ПРИЕХАЛИ С БЛАГОСЛОВЕНИЯ КАДЫРОВА И ЗА ДЕНЬГИ, %
www.dpni.org, 02.06.2014%
}). 

This was despite the denials from Chechen president and Kremlin appointee
Kadyrov that he had directed any Chechens to go to Donbas. Ethnic-Russian
nationalists question the commitment of the Chechens and other North Caucasians
to the cause of \enquote{Novorossiya} (\enquote{New Russia,} a vision declared
by Vladimir Putin on April 17 calling for bringing southeastern Ukraine under
some form of Russian control—see EDM, May 1). 

Rather, many ethnic Russians perceive people from the
Caucasus as foreign at best and all too often as hostile aliens. Indeed, there
has been a spate of race riots against people from the Caucasus in Russia in
recent times (see EDM, March 5), which presumably was something the organizers
of the May 18 rally were trying to provoke. It is tempting to conclude that the
irregular Russian juggernaut now fighting in eastern Ukraine is held together
by its common goals, but it will have to keep winning future victories or it
will dissolve in internal squabbling.

The evidence that the Kremlin is working with neo-Nazi or ultranationalist
forces in Donbas is highly ironic but not surprising. The regime’s allies in
the Russian Far Right make the Kremlin’s warnings of a \enquote{neo-Nazi} takeover in
Kyiv seem even more incredulous. Ostensibly, it was concerns over the role of
the Ukrainian neo-Nazi group \enquote{Right Sector} and its leader Dmitri Yarosh in the
new government that served as justification for the Russian government to annex
Crimea. Kremlin propaganda from the time told of mass shootings carried out by
Right Sector and even broadcast what it alleged to be photographs of corpses
lying in freshly-dug mass graves

(\href{http://antimaydan.info/2014/03/lider_neonacistskoj_gruppirovki_pravyj_sektor_dmitrij_yarosh_zayavil__37446.html}{%
Лидер неонацистской группировки «Правый сектор» Дмитрий Ярош заявил о создании карательного батальона «Правый сектор — Восток» для подавления русского восстания на Юго-Востоке Украины, antimaydan.info, 13.03.2014%
}).

While, Right Sector has indeed been involved in a number of violent actions in
Ukraine such as an April 2014 attack on a court and judge in the country

(\href{http://novorossy.ru/news/news_post/pravyy-sektor-zahvatil-verhovnyy-sud-ukrainy-a-nakazhut-yugo}{%
Правый сектор захватил верховный суд Украины, а "накажут" юго-восток, novorossy.ru, 07.04.2014%
}),

the fact that the Kremlin is working with its own domestic neo-Nazi movement
makes its claims seem all the more disingenuous.

The Russian Far Right’s involvement in the Ukraine crisis and its growing ties
to the Kremlin also provide a warning of how volatile the current situation is
inside Russia itself. If such trends continue, the next Kremlin occupant could
very well be openly sympathetic to the Russian neo-Nazi movement, and such an
outcome would truly be a dire situation for the country, Eurasia and the world
(see EDM, February 13, 2012).

Yeah, Marijka, there are neo-nazis all over the world, even where I live in

you focus on Ukrainian fascists, who actually now have power and are killing

\iusr{Sergey Povzner}

Your trip to Moscow, the aggressor in this war, has been clearly very
illuminating.

I would humbly suggest you also visit Kyiv and speak to families and friends of
those who were killed on Maidan. It is well established that the vast majority
of murdered people on Maidan were protesters. It is surprising to see
statements to the contrary about such basic facts from someone who is working
on a historical movie.

Reading some history books about Ukraine in the 20th century would also be a
great idea: both Timothy Snyder and Anne Applebaum have written excellent books
on this subject.

And finally, since you are working on a movie about Ukraine and Ukrainians, I
suggest that you premiere it in Kyiv. In person, of course.

\iusr{David Karlin}

Mr. Stone, your movies are good. you as a person not so much. I don't know why
and how you found friends among russian government crooks, but knowing that
fact I assume that you're a sell out. Yanukovitch and his circle were corrupted
scumbags (such as the current russian authorities). when Yanukovich lost his
power due to Maidan movement, russians became angry and sent troops to Ukraine.
as a proof - russian soldiers in Kiev shooting policemen and Maidan activists.
later they were found in Crimea and some of them went to Donetsk-Donbas (many
of them died there but officially they never been there). the Malay plane? most
evidences point out it was pro-russian separatists led by russian KGB officer
Girkin-Strelkov who bragged about it few minutes later online not yet knowing
it was a civil plane.

so I now wonder what do you plan with your new friends, what kind of propaganda
might come out from this cooperation

\iusr{Peter Iwanec}

What is wrong with Ukraine wanting to be free? When the Soviets helped
revolutionary factions in central America Oliver Stone was all for it. So why
is it wrong for good Christian people in their own land who have been abused by
circumstances of history to yearn for freedom?

involved?

\iusr{Dzvinka Siatetska}

Ok, you decided to make a documentary on the Ukrainian revolution. You've made
your trip to Moscow to interview the corrupt ex-president. In any documentary,
all sides views are presented. Why don't you make a trip to Kyiv now and
interview the people that were standing on Maidan, the families of those that
were killed?

\iusr{Сергій Атаманчук}

Mr. Stone you are focused on USA "intrusion", but fail to see how Russia
intrudes into Ukraine. If USA was so into Ukraine wouldnt they send weapons to
support the war against Russia?

\iusr{Roman Krutokhvostov}

Mr. Stone, the way it was done much more looks like The Battle of Athens
(1946), just on a larger scale.

It is very strange of you to call special service and special enforcement
troopers "policemen" and even strange not to give a number , just..."many".
What is "many"? More than 100 civilians are known to be killed AFTER being
kidnapped and tortured by these "policemen".

From your next statement one can conclude that German Nazis were supporting
creation of a separate Ukrainian State - BRAVO.

Beginning in 1947-48 USSR:

a) blocked Marshall Plan, which I believed was offered to Ukraine as a state
with a presence in United Nations, thus leading Ukrainians to cannibalism
because of famine.

b) was constantly violating Potsdam Agreement and Paris Peace Treaties for decades.

I assume a) is an enough reason to start organize guerrillas due to Truman
Doctrine, but b) is also important.

The big picture is now-reduced-Russia doesn't want to release Ukraine for its
industry placed in the chain of the armament production in Russia starting with
the mining of uranium. The last move is possible creation of buffer state of
"Novorossia" or whatever it will be called in order to avoid direct contact
with Ukrainian diplomacy and third-country or UN arbitrage.

Maybe you and some leader abroad enjoy thinking that that leader can start a
new military-diplomatic competition vs US, but in reality it is his own
hallucination, which you, Mr Stone, are discussing as something real.

\iusr{Vadym Ivanynyuk}

Sure, Me. Stone, pro-western, indeed... You would probably prefer Tian an men
square way, when Russian tanks do the job without any "pro-western" support.
Like Putin's "democracy" as we see it now in Russia where any non-pro
government meeting is being suppressed by police? Want all world be like that?
"Stockholm syndrome"? Then go ahead, listen to the Yanukovich, make movies how
good is Putin and feed Americans with this crap. But if you think your millions
will save you from the catastrophe you were helping to create - think again....

Maidan showed humanity at its finest- the bravest people i've ever seen, and at

What is CIA there for if the majority wanted him out ? Would you like to say
that CIA made Yanukovich act like the worst and most corrupt president ? Now
you don't have an answer, and to provide cover you make up some "Nightingale"
story and conspiracy theories. What can it prove ? Only the fact that you have
no more arguments. So, the only proof of western interference is Nuland/McCain

As to Yanukovych, he is the one who ran away to Russia. Via the UAE/Qatar where
his presidential plane was seen landing and making deposits of large sums into
foreign banks before seeking refuge in Russia taking the family silver of
Ukraine with him. The West was just as much taken by surprise at him taking off
like that when he had called for early elections. I take it everyone is allowed
to fight for freedom and independence as long as it is not Ukraine trying to
free herself from the oppression of Vladimir Purin's United Russia and
Aleksander Dugin's NWO nightmare of an Eurasian Union which is following
Goebel's handbook on fascist autocracy to the letter. Just because you have
always opposed US' s hypocrisy (with films I still rate as some of the best),
does not mean you have to see a US conspiracy behind everything. The support
the USA and the West has given Ukraine is still shabby at best and a far cry
from what was promised under the Budapest Memorandum. Recommended reading:

honest person is just pathetic.

Вы производите впечатление здравомыслящего человека, не боящегося выражать свое
мнение, даже если оно выпадает за рамки общепринятого мышления. Значит, мир еще
не совсем сошел с ума. Спасибо, что вы есть!

And do you really believe in a crap you are posting about Ukraine? Did you
actually go to Ukraine and talked to people who made Ukrainian revolution
happen by standing and fighting in a freezing cold for three months? Did you
look through the tons of evidence - pictures, videos, etc., which suggesting
that it is not CIA, but Moscow hand was involved in shootings? And maybe you
also need to tell everybody a truth - how exactly you were motivated to do an
interview with Yanukovich, a criminal, who betrayed own people by stealing from
them and then killing them?

\iusr{Olga Zaiceva}
Thank You for your work .!! Thank for the truth

Dear Mr Stone, there were also Vlasov militarists and another - anti-Russian
army in Russia - is it also because of US-activities? and secondly - would you
like to do interview also with Hitler? just curious...

The doctors treating the injured prior to the putsch noticed that those who had
been shot, both police and protestors, were shot with same bullets. They went
as far as to suggest that it was the same unknown snipers shooting both sides,
a cia tactic to create fear and uncertainty and all that is required before a
coup.

That was long ago investigated thoroughly and they were shot with different shooters. Police ARs and protestors hunting rifles were involved

\iusr{Mike Raddie}
Investigated by the junta? Yeah cause that's going to be credible and believable

\iusr{Dmitriy Zay}
Dear sir Stone, do not pay attention to furious attacks of neo-Nazis. Your knowledge of history and creativity caused respect. Health to you and your relatives. Happy New Year!

\iusr{Victor Galkin}
Oh, indeed? And why are so many protesters shot dead while being unarmed and it is still not investigated?

\iusr{Iryna Buczkowski}
Money talks! Putler pays big for this!

\iusr{Julie Gabriel}
Wow wow... The man is just asking for his new russian passport.

This CIA conspiracy thing would be a little easier to swallow if the Ukrainians had managed to extract something more lethal than mres from USA

If you want to make a movie about nightingale make a movie about nightingale, stop pretending any connection to contemporary times

\iusr{Maria Cenko}

Counter to your proposition, as to some bizarre connection of maidan to nazis
perhaps you should look into the demonstrated fact as to how firmly Jews
supported and in fact participated in maidan, fact that Jews supported maidan
is well documented


\iusr{Maria Cenko}

Incidentally referring to Ukraine as the underbelly of Russia demonstrates to
me that you come to this project viewing Ukrainians with a predetermined
prejudice and bias and as somehow inferior to Russians. I believe you are a
racist mr stone


\iusr{Vyacheslav Lozin}

Mr.Stone, continue please with your work, don't let the mob derail or slow you down.

"Linda Green" what a lovely pretend name... To go with your fake profile. We
are supposed to believe that a British lady from Bristol has this much
knowledge of and understanding of what is Crimea's history and referendum.
Let's suppose, for a moment, that you are, Linda, a genuine person (you're not)
but simply a gullible RT watcher, wouldn't your English grammar be better?
"No-one were killed in Crimea" - really? And, setting aside your poor English,
the debate about the take over of Crimea isn't about the flawed vote but about
the armed seizure of Crimea's parliament building on February 27th and the
armed occupation of the peninsula prior to the obviously illegal and faked
vote.


\iusr{Stuart Miles}
Thank you for speaking your mind, good luck.

Oliver Stone "300.000 likes" - most popular fan city (Moscow, Russian Federation). Wonder who pay your bills mr. Stone?

\iusr{Edwin Verburg}

There is no such thing as a former KGB agent. Russian's president IS still KGB
(or whatever you will call it these days) and therefore not trustworthy. Why
does anyone in its right mind want to "attack" ruSSia. The majority just wants
to be as far from it as possible...

\iusr{Olena Sklyarova}

It will be all well with Mr. stone as he lives in civilization with CIA and you
stay in the world where journalists dissappear, where you cant protect yourself
in court if you are not oligarh, and where you cant reelect a president as
elections cancelled or falsificated as in Russia Belarus Kazahstan. if Mr.Stone
lives here he would quickly find the difference and likes CIA more than kgb.


\iusr{Александр Сергиенко}
You're right, Mr. Stone and do not need any excuses for yours actions. Especially in the eyes of these "believers in the Holy Maidan."

\iusr{Леонид Ланцм}
Yeah. To be consistent, Mr. Stone, you should also deny US landed on the Moon.

\iusr{Adhil Cherkani}
Thank u Mr. Stone.

\iusr{Marcin Miller}
with a hart beat waiting for interview with Hitler and his revelation about UFO involvement in Auschwitz-Birkenau holiday camp

\iusr{Alexander Petrenko}

Mr. Stone, we understand your point. Just don't try to persuade direct
witnesses of what happened that it is wider and bigger than just a small point.


\iusr{Yuriy Prokopets}
Shame... Why you talk to international criminal instead of ukrainian people for making your film?

A lot of trash and naive delusion from Mr. Stone.

\iusr{Mykola Voskalo}

why do you living in miami, alex? go back to sevastopol, it's russia now and you love russia, don't you?

\iusr{Nazar Semkiv}

This is rediculious. Mr. Stone what the hell is wrong with you? You are looking
from the point "I hate American goverment". Why don't you look from the point
of Ukrainian people. That would the tough one.
