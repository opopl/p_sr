History repeats today. Appeasement policy did not work to stop Hitler and now
does not work and cannot stop Putin! Like Hitler started from annexion of
Аustria (anshlus) and occupying part of Czechoslovak Republic (Sudetes) and
attacking Poland - the same thing Putin does today! War against Gergia,
annexing Crimea (part of the Ukraine) and now Putin started war against the
Ukraine...

To Iran, India, Pakіstan, and others: Please do not repeat the mistake of the
Ukraine, do not join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
because there are no "Security Assurances" for you!!!!

It was a big mistake for the Ukraine to join Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons in exchange for "Security Assurances" - now Russia annexed part
of the Ukraine and started war against the Ukraine, russian solders have
invaded to Ukraine, but other countries forgot about their obligations on
"Security Assurances" and do almost nothing to save the Ukraine from Russia -
they are just "deeply concerned"....

\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances}

According to the memorandum, Russia, the U.S., and the UK confirmed, in
recognition of Ukraine becoming party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons and in effect abandoning its nuclear arsenal to Russia, that
they would:

* Respect Ukrainian independence and sovereignty within its existing borders.

* Refrain from the threat or use of force against Ukraine.

* Refrain from using economic pressure on Ukraine in order to influence its
politics.

* Seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance
to Ukraine, "if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an
object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used".

* Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against Ukraine.

* Consult with one another if questions arise regarding these commitments.

For those who claim "Ukraine is a different state after revolution". Do you
also confirm that such a new state has no obligations on credits and has no
debt any more? Do you confirm that new Ukraine has no obligations on Treaty on
the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ans can create new Nuclear Weapons
now?

You do not search a true, and chase after sensation. you were not on Maydan,
you did not talk to the people, you did not see as ten militiamen beat
unmercifully a lying man only for that he went out on demonstration.
Interestingly, show you in the film as beat unmercifully students, how in a
city brought gangsters and they beat demonstrators, how a militia killed
protesting ?

These people are interior ministry troops. It's a shame they were subjected to
this. In the very same location at the same time there is video footage showing
their senior and more brutal Berkut colleagues shooting at medics and
journalists and also attacking a first aid centre on one of their many baton
charges.

\iusr{Neil Campbell}

Stone, have you watched the videos of the police and Berkut firing upon the
protestors, beating them senseless, stripping them naked in freezing
temperatures, and shooting them dead with precision sniper rifles? DO SOME
FUCKING HOMEWORK!!!!

KIEV - maidan / rebellion February 22, 2014

This happened after weeks and weeks of police brutality.

Weeks of police brutality? Bitter laugh... In Moscow 1993, about 2000 people
were shot by orders of "democratic paragon", president Yeltsin. That's
brutality. Most of you Americans applauded to that "friend of democracy",
because his actions were sanctioned by international tycoons and therefore
praised by your mass media. While Yanukovich allowed putschists to shout for
weeks in the center of Kiev, gathering forces for the coup, calling on to
overthrow the govt. Weeks of idiotism - for sure. Brutality? Laugh!

Kiev maidan February 22, 2014

\iusr{Paul Niland}
Not Maidan, Hrushevskoho street, 1 km from Maidan.

\iusr{J.V. Ayson}

It is in Ukraine, where the CIA orchestrated a coup d'eat against the
Yanukovych regime in Kiev, and installed a regime of oligarchs and fascists led
by Poroshenko.
