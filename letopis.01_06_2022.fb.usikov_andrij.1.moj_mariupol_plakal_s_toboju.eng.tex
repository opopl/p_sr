I was there today,
Turned back at the crack of dawn.
I've seen all that they've made to you..
Children are now buried on playgrounds,
And near the entrance our neighbor is sprinkled with dirt.
I saw that horror, and my nose was not tickled by spring,
My city is now like a cemetery of peaceful people!
I can't breath with my chest here,
Death was flying viciously.
A town full of corpses,
bodies among yards and alleys...
I was there today,
Returned at the break of dawn,
I saw the ruins and a banished city to the ground. Isterzan, weary of war, who did not live to see summer...
my Mariupol - now only dust and evil...
Burning up my hopes ,
And destinies collapsed, there are thousands of missing people,
I was there today... it's quiet now and it's empty. It's scary to walk along its squares.
I was there today,
I had no tears from the pain,
And at midnight pierced my raging scream,
My Mariupol, today I cried with you!
And in the morning I woke up... and the old man looks in the mirror.
