Dear Mr Garrett,

Please, may I address you with the following.

I have been reading with great pleasure your posts on facebook
popularising the work of different Ukrainian artists. Thank you
so much for your activity and support of Ukraine and Ukrainian culture.
Myself, I work in Kyiv as a software developer. My past background is in theoretical
physics.

In my free time, I have a project on Internet Archive of preserving
different interesting publications - basically, for the purpose of preserving
and organizing them in a systematic and searchable manner, so that it would be 
easy to sort publications by author, date, topic. The overall general idea is to create a Library of modern history of Ukraine
covering different topics. The original posts on facebook
are converted to a records in Internet Archive and saved as PDF files
which can be then easily viewed and downloaded as a single file (and then printed if necessary).
My account at Internet Archive is 
https://archive.org/details/@oleksandr_poplavskyy
I have saved there in my account already two of your posts and I would be glad to save
more if you are ok with this. In such a way, 
all your posts if saved (I believe there are hundreds of them devoted to Ukrainian art and artists) could be viewed all at once,
which would be very convenient for readers.

Also Your saved posts there look as following:

https://archive.org/details/12_08_2023.fb.rob_garrett.day_535.ukrainian_artist_ganna_kryvolap
https://archive.org/details/11_08_2023.fb.garret_rob.art_teacher.ukrainian_artist_iryna_yermolova_202308

And the list of all posts by author looks like this (one has to make a search query):

https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22Rob+Garrett%22

Would be happy to know your opinion on this.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Kind regards,

Oleksandr Poplavskyy.
