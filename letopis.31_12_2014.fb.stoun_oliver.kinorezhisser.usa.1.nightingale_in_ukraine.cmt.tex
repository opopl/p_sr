Mr. Stone, in your interview with Mr. Posner you state "when the government of
one's country is breaking the law, it is the right and the duty of the honest
citizen, to protest, and to support the protests of others who go to jail".

That is exactly what happened in Ukraine beginning in December 2013, when
hundreds of thousands, millions of Ukrainians, said "enough is enough" to the
Yanukovych regime, in a remarkably brave show of citizen responsibility. No
external force in the world is capable of motivating that many people to risk
much, including their lives, to go into the streets in protest of a regime that
was not only corrupt, but breaking the laws of Ukraine with criminal abandon.
Would you stand for that in the US? 

Additionally, your last posts, tweets, and interviews touching on Ukraine are
so ridden with irresponsible statements that they cannot even be taken
seriously. In the interview with Mr. Posner you also state that you never
studied history, only finding time to do so later in life.

Please do yourself a favor by continuing with this trend and reading up on East
European history. Good books to start with would be those by your compatriots
Anne Applebaum and Timothy Snyder. And best of all, why don't you visit Ukraine
to gather information, instead of getting all of it second-hand from the
sputtering Russian propaganda machine. Isn't that what every self-respecting
researcher should do?

A genuine protest ceases to be genuine when it's fueled (and financed) by an
interested third side  @igg{fbicon.wink}  In such a case it simply becomes a coup, a shift of
power from one hands to another (in this case even worse hands). I live in
Kherson, Ukraine. I have never been Yanukovich admirer, changes in the country
really were a necesity, but what happened here was not a revolution, but a
coup. Some people were really led to believe that something's going to better,
some (and a lot of them, actually) were ultra-right imbeciles used as a muscle
force to propel this coup. And all this action was artificially stirred up by
mysterious snipers, trained people, organization, propaganda and financing. All
to serve interests of certain people and certain parties. Oliver Stone asks you
to see the bigger picture, and you clearly don't want to see it. Moreover you
offer to read Applebaum and Snyder, those are purest propaganda, not a history
literature.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

@Maxim: exactly. The Ukrainians are blind. And those who can see are threatened
and shut up....

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

those heroes then proceded to slaughter those of their countrymen who did not
agree with them. The massacre at Odessa spells the end of a unitary Ukraine.
Had they simply wished to exercise their democratic rights, there were
scheduled elections on the way - they did not need to carry out a coup d'etat.

\iusr{Joanna Prisiajniouk}

Pro Russian brain washed posts! You all forgot about Holodomor! Be careful of what you wish for!!!

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Eric Kraus sorry to tell you but there were no scheduled elections on the way
(1 year and half is a very long time) and the previous one was just a joke so
no any real chance of a fair one. The early election proposed by Mr. Yanykovich
were followed by the order to disperse the square probably with the intention
of repliacate the Bielorussian experience (this is only an opinion no one can
know what was in his mind). On the contrary current war in Ukraine (I don't
speak about Odessa massacre since it will be only my opinion) has created a
unitary State. It was Mr. Putin hope that Ukraine would fade after the invasion
in Crimea but his plan failed and now Ukrainian are much more unite than before
and than you can think.


\iusr{Demetrius Kolczyński}

Where did you get that "A genuine protest ceases to be genuine when it's fueled
(and financed) by an interested third side"? That's the way things are in
Russia's world of slavery. But Ukraine is a different case. For a long time
now. So better gain some balls to create genuine protest)))

\iusr{Rainer Schulte}

Wars are made for ENERGY DOMINANCE- and Ukraine got in this whirlpool! of
international interests. I am very sad that the Civilians pay for this- loosing
their homes and be killed. There must be a solution- but with a Presindent
saying WE ARE READY FOR WAR is not a help. UKRAINE should be a NEUTRAL COUNTRY-
like Switzerland. But now they lean to the WEST. Remember Germany does not
exist legally- we are still occupied by ALLIED forces and even pay for this
every year! We need PEACE in EUROPE and a powerful economic structure- and this
includes Russia- which has enough internal problems to be resolved, too. But in
any case, Russia is an important trade partner for any country in Europe and
Asia. Make Business- NOT WAR! You have enough resources to be a free and
powerful country- so you all should try to go this way.

\iusr{Cannibal Christoth}
Lol

\iusr{Vadym Ivanynyuk}

Amen! What is in American constitution - can be applied to any country.
Yanukovich did everything possible to call this protest from Ukrainians.

\iusr{Daniel Rajala}

Oliver Stone who is one of greatest filmmakers of our times intends to mire his
hands in the dirt and sleaze of Russian lies against a nation wanting democracy
and human rights against provocateurs, liars, manipulators and thieves of
Russia who want to steer Ukraine into similar system of destruction of freedom
of speech, quash oppositions to ruling regime, and eliminating a chance for
improved human rights against the state system. Don't tar your mighty name with
a massive list of masterpieces with this trite, disgusting shit about CIA
manipulating Ukraine.

It is more than plain and obvious that the people were fed up with their
leaders who failed them - with big help of Russia - yet again. Coup succeeded,
but then started annexations and Russian-style aggression to take regions of an
independent country. The problem with Ukraine turning to west is that without
doing it Russia would weaken and maintain in it poverty and undeveloped for
long time. Corrupt officials, corrupt leaders, corrupt army would linger on,
who doesn't want to change circumstances if you live in a desperate and
hopeless situation without seeing improvement in your horizon... Stone don't
drown in this cesspool of lies and moronic rubbish...

\iusr{Emil Wojtechko}

Oliver Stone seems to be as corrupt as Putin and Yanukovich. Mr. Stone why
don't you visit Ukraine instead of buying the Russian Propaganda? Is it that
Yanukovich and Outin are paying millions to have you spread their propaganda?
What about the a Ukrainian a People? Don't they have a right to their language,
culture and country?


\iusr{Roman Makuch}

How was it a coup? After Yanuconvict left, the elected Parliament followed the
Constitution. That does not make it a coup.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Ok, Then why don't you tell us, MR Stone, whose idea it was to create this
movie and who paid for it? I don't think you are doing this from your own
pocket. Also, why are you calling Ukrainians Nazis? are they going to Russia to
kill russians? Has russian person ever been pressurised in Ukraine? you have no
idea what I had to go through just for speaking my own Ukrainian language in my
own country! If you fight with American government then go and live in Cuba or
Africa, or Russia! Could you? Give some land to American native indian
population!

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

\iusr{Vincenzo Lachimera}

You were never persecuted for speaking Ukrainian in Ukraine, that is a lie.
According to google 93\% of Ukrainians choose Russian when given the options at
the ATM cash machine. Putin and Stalin are not standing there with a gun
forcing them. What you are saying is you are from the west of Ukraine, which is
not really traditional Ukraine but Poland and once Lithuania. When this war is
over we will see the borders looking more like they did 100 years ago, and you
can go back to speaking the language of your ancestors, Polish! The Russian
people who have been trapped inside the false Soviet creation that is the
present borders of Ukraine will go back to being within Russian territory just
like Russian republic Crimea. The beautiful Russian culture that is Odessa will
be free of the humourless Ukrainians and murdering Banderovie!

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Another one that knows better from Vancuver. How do you know where exactly Im
coming from and my family? and your knowledge of ukrainian history sucks! and
it's not about ATM cash points' language, it's more about the attitude
everywhere you go (transport, events, radio and television etc). Please, do me
a favour, go back to google and learn more.

\iusr{Nestor Miguel Gorojovsky}

Nobody is calling the Ukrainians Nazis. Stone is calling the Nazis Nazis. There
are Nazis in Ukraine. And they share in the rule of the country with
neoliberals who always are cozy with Nazis. They pretend to be "the
Ukrainians", and they are not. That simple.


\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
a good description of Yanukovich himself and the people around him!

\iusr{Steve Poe}

In the current Ukraine people get assaulted in the street by Ukrainian
Nationalists and told to speak Ukrainian. That is in the city where Russian was
spoken since the city was founded.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Steve, do you live in Ukraine? Only your name itself says you have no idea what
you are talking about! Washington is quite far to understand the situation.
It's like the spanish language speakers (and you have them thousands in US!)
told you to speak spanish and not English. We are called ukrainians, we have
our beautiful language and traditions and russian population don't respect it.
But what can you know living in USA and typing from the sofa in Washington.

\iusr{Martin Schröder}

"Are they going to russia to kill russians".. uh yes. They go to russian parts
of ukraine to kill russians. Instead of letting them be part of Ukraine. These
russians are born in ukraine so it's their home and they don't like being shot
at in their own homeland. Ukraine has some kind of autoimmune disease like a
cancer or something. It is killing off it's own organs. Like a kind of suicide.
Who pushed Ukraine into this downward spiral?

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Oh well... from Sweden you know better, boy. Let me open your eyes abit and
enjoy more your beautiful life in Sweden. Stalin created Holodomor (1932-33)
also known as years of hunger. He killed millions of ukrainians on the borders
with Russia and sent there criminal russians to work on the mines. What
homeland for russians you talk about? They been sent there to destroy my
nation, ukrainian nation.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Martin you are not Ukrainian or Russian , you don't know what are you talking
about... Work , collect pension in your country ... If you support Nazi , then
Nazi chambers is your place , no pension ...lol

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Nazis are Nazis, no other name

\iusr{Александр Янчук}
No, Victoria, Kiev sent their troops to kill Ukrainians on the east.. And this is in fact. This is worse than to kill Russians I believe so.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
In that case, Александр янчук, Russia sent their troops to Abhazia, Chechnya, Prednistrovya to kill russians?

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

You are being unreasonable... you cannot understand ukrainian soul for the
reason you're not being one and had never lived in USSR. The torture ukrainian
nation went through being under the reign of Russia till the present day is
tremendous! It is better be under the reign of USA than with russians. You
should of just went to live In Russia and then have a conversatuon with me.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}
Its all provocatiins, Gerard.. provocations only.

\iusr{Viktoria Dmytrivna}

Russia wants to take the land of Donbass as its rich and full of mines with
coal. The people in Donbass is nothing for Russia as they didnt even move the
finger to help refugees from there! They are dumping a huge pile of shit on
them! The only thing they care is the land!

\iusr{Soldiers are not heroes, they are tools of war.}

Glad Mr. Stone has the courage that so many in the mainstream lack. Truth
tellers are rarely liked, and I'm glad Oliver Stone is willing to say things
that aren't popular. Unbending beliefs get people killed, whether that's an
unbending belief in a god or a belief in a nation. People are never open to new
information when they hold so strongly to their often misguided beliefs.

Hello!!! Kiev and the western Ukrainians are killing their own people, or

the case then they are trying to kill anyone that thinks differently than them.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Everyone with a little brain knows what happened in Ukraine. It was clear from
the start. It was well planned and organised coup d'état against legal
gouvernment, with first goal to replace it with pro-USA puppets and idiots.
Second goal was to use Ukraine situation and with controling of new gouverment
to move them against Russia. And third goal was to move Europe against Russia
by creating crysis and false treat. To destroy all relations between Russia and
Europe, to make economic problems for both of them and in the end to again make
Europe depend from USA. Sad thing is that all of that worked for now.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Well Yulia nobody want to depend on anybody. I can agree with that. We all want
to be free, but sad thing is that we dont live in that world. For Ukraine was
maybe the best option to be neutral but as we saw nobody want you let to do
that. But Russia is in border with Ukraine with large population of Russians
who live there and your economy is similar to Russian so you have naterul
conections with them... And Europe, Europe only needs from you cheap labour and
cheap resources. USA dont need even that, they just need some point where
relations between Europe and Russia will broke... and Ukraine is ideal, deep
divided country...

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}
Luc, at least they are much more calmer then USA, as we saw in every contry in which USA come is war and misery...

\iusr{Igor Des}
If it was "clear", the facts certainly don't support it

\iusr{Юрий Сорока}

How can people be so stupid? If Russia is so smart and good, regardless of the
"coup" they should have just obeyed the international laws and agreements and
honored Ukraine's sovereignty. So Ukraine and Russia would've been friends.
Instead, Putin invades Crimea and Donbass, causing immense manslaughter and
humanitarian disaster.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Problem with that coup was that it wasnt supported by some of half Ukraine
people. Problem was that majority of Crimean population are Russian, that in
Donbass live people who are conected with Russia, which whole economy depend on
Russia. Problem for Ukraine is that man from Lviv and man from Donetsk dont
want and dont think the same. That is a problem for Ukraine and not imaginary
Putin invasion. Sure Russia supported east (guns,ammo, some soldiers), but also
we know who supported coup. So aim of all that was that you and Russia wouldnt
be friends any more (you have good relations with Russia and EU). And well
Crimea they choose their destiny, they decide to go and who can blame them.
That is how it work, it is called democracy arent. That Maidan guys nobody
normal dont want to have around his home. So you are stupid if you dont see
where your country go, that you have deep divided country and that problems are
just started, only good thing in all that is that most people in Ukraine (no
matter on side which they are) are good people and dont want to go to war
against each other.

\iusr{Ed Kromskoy}

Vladan, in every country where russia came is war and misery. Moldova, Georgia,
now Ukraine. Also they have enough internal conflicts. You just prefer to put
blind eye. This is very short history from 1991, before that USSR was
responsible for many wars.

\iusr{Ed Kromskoy}

Vladan, ukraine is more united than ever. stop watching russia today. yep,
perhaps 15\% of populations are not happy with the choice and would prefer to
build back ussr. it is never good for everyone.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

In Moldova there is no war. Georgia, as I remember very well all started when
their idiotic president decide to bomb his own people, kill some Ossetians and
with all that some Russian soldiers. So in the end even Georgians alone decide
to move that idiot, and where he go, in USA offcorse. And Ukraine was good
until you start received USA advices. Russia today, I dont need that to make my
opinion. We live in informatic society where informations are easy to reach.
15\% well we both know that it is not truth, just Russians in Ukraine are 17\%.
And I am sure that except members of communist party most of them dont want to
see USSR back., but they want to stay close to Russia and to not become another
American puppet.


\iusr{Lida Zinko}

I am so tired of hearing that what happened in Ukraine was "a coup" - just
repeating of Russian propaganda. The street protest is the ultimate, hands on
exercise in democracy, This was supported by majority of Ukrainians, a coup is
overthrow by a SMALL FACTION.. Anyway, since the so called 'coup", there was
legitimate elections, so this is moot point already

\iusr{Piotr Chmurnik}

In Moldova (Pridniestrowie) Russian occupation troops are stationed. In Georgia
also has troops occupying (Abkhazia, Ossetia). The Crimea was illegal
referendum. It does not matter from where the majority speaks Russian. The
future of the territory may exclusively authorized to decide the whole nation
of Ukraine. Deciding can not only part of the nation. Neither the Russian army.
I'm sure putler, would not agree to any part of Russia disconnecting after the
referendum.

Vladan, you are 100\% right with your evaluation of situation and it does not
make sense to discuss here anything with Ukrainian people, today they are all
under umbrella of their anti Russian propaganda and will decline all facts
converting them to their internal "true". But sooner or later they will
recognize that Western who was actively pushing them out of Russia and there
they all so willing to live (but in fact will only get some cheap work) is not
going to pay for it, closed all borders for entrance, we already see it now
after one year that Ukraine is close to default and nobody except Russia (still
!!!) want to give them money ... I am sure that smart people (and they
definitely does exist in Ukraine) will soon change their mind who is friend and
who is enemy.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

They just show how easy is to manipulate with people. And they are manipulated
with false hopes and promises. And offcorse that nobody give them money,
because there is no money, at least for Ukraine, they are just too big and too
poor, 44 milion people who can finance that. Europe dont have money for that.
Eu and all that... it is even crazy to think. I understand that is so nice to
live in dreams but it is also very useful to come back to reality and use brain
from time to time.

\iusr{Yuriy Gruzglin}

Vladan, perhaps you should make a trip to Ukraine, go see Kiev, Lviv,
Dnepropetrovsk, travel to Donetsk and Lugansk (it is the city where I was born
and lived for 40 years). Talk to people everywhere you go, listen to what they
say, look around.

You are thinking that in this informative world you know a lot but it is not
necessarily true: if you trust sources that are not impartial so will be your
conclusions. You seem to know all the answers upfront.

And by the way, this may be an unexpected news for you: today Ukraine is more
united than ever in its history.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Yuriy, well before all this I planing to visit Ukraine (In fact Lviv and Kiev),
but now, I survived one war and I think that it is enough one per life  @igg{fbicon.smile}  Even
if there is no fighting, atmosphere in society completly change, and that is
just not it anymore. As I was born in country which was destroyed in bloody war
(much bloodier then this what you have) and all this what happen in Ukraine I
allready lived (War,"Better life dream", propaganda, "We are more unite than
ever", "Evil enemy"...and then comes Selling factories, higher prices, more
corruption, loosing independence, unemployment and eternal instability). .
Problem is when you are in situation like Ukraine is that you dont see things
racially. You have worst possibile government now, USA puppets, ideal for
manipulation (Bad past, a lot of things to hide, some of them are openly
nazi-well now they hide it, it is not so european), you think that Yanukovych
was corrupted wait them a little. Probably only normal guy there is Poroshenko.
And as that united thing, well some parts of Ukraine wants to go, that I dont
see as some unity, and incredible only thing which save them in Ukraine is
Russia (because even Russia dont know what to do with them).

\iusr{Юрий Ко}

United Ukraine? First it is not the truth, otherwise who are all these people
in Donetsk and Lugansk, second if you remember, people in Germany were also
quite United during Second World War with small exclusions, but it does not
mean they there on the right side... Propaganda can make incredible influence
on people and this is now happening in Ukraine, people do not understand now
where is the true and what is good and what is bad.

Keith, attacking Russia's human rights is a red herring in this debate. Mr.
Stone has made no comments about Russia at all. When Khrushchev denounced
Stalin for millions of murders, do you think he was somehow pro-Hitler? The
enemy of your enemy is not necessarily your friend!

As an aside, the treaty you mentioned is the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on
Security Assurances and isn't a treaty. In fact, according to the State Dept in
2013, this memorandum "is not legally binding" as no country has ratified it
(see \url{http://minsk.usembassy.gov/budapest_memorandum.html} ).

However, in 2014, the State Dept decided that this Memorandum is indeed a good
weapon with which to attack Russia (see

If the US legitimately believes Crimea was 'annexed' by Russia against its

Dear Mr. Stone. I can understand your desire to uncover conspiracy in what

Ukrainian society to return to Europe after 300 years of colonial dependency on
Russian empire. Maybe the bigger picture you were looking for is that Ukraine,
which had no state for centuries kept its identity and will for independence
transferred from generation to generation. Look at our history, find out that
Russia started to call itself Russia only starting from 1700s. Who had this
name before? And by the way Mr. Yanukovich is not only most corrupt President.

Dear Mr. Stone, I was in Kyiv the day of the shooting. I have close friends
that got shot during that day and that know exactly where the shooting came
from.

There are plenty of videos documenting who was shooting at at whom. If there
were CIA agents they were wearing SBU and Berkut uniforms and were sitting
inside the government buildings which is quite unlikely considering that many
FSB agents were on site.

If there were any external influence it was a political level, not inside the
Maidan movement.

Please be so kind to speak with the people who almost died that day and with
Ukrainian journalists, you will find a very different story and maybe blame Mr.
Putin for what happened. Also the number of policemens that died that day is
wrong : official police report 8 deaths (one of heart attack) during the
clashes in Kyiv.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

It is also not true that Ukrainian Authorities have refused to have an outside
groud of inverstigation: they refused Russian lead investigation. You can ask
to the ICC a copy of the official request by Ukrainian interim government on
April 18 2014.


\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

Everyone have the right to inform and I really hope that someone will make a
film aboud what it really happened. This is why I suggested Mr. Stone to read
official documents (most are made under Yanyovich regime), speak with people
(including police) before writing something not correct (for example about the
number of policemens the tragically died that day). Living in Ukraine and
having some friends and parents in the occupied Donbass you can imagine that
I'm very touched by this crisis and while a nuclear war is a very remote
possibility loosing a loved one is a everyday reality in Ukraine.

@Andrea Bodrati: all you are saying is a lie. Total lie. The snipers were

so called "the Maidan commandant", the son of the bitch who organized the
Odessa disaster in May where more than 40 people were burnt to dead. YouTube
for help. All Odessa crime and Porubiy fingerprints evidenced and recorded ....
So let's come back to Maidain shooting.... Why were the tries cut on the square
where shooting began? Because they could shed light on bullets trajectory.....
Why there is no official investigation? Because the officials ruling now in
Kiev are the ones to be blamed and charged in this crime... As to Donbass and
particularly Donetsk city so you say that people that want to be independent
from Kiev are not majority there? Lol.... Quite strange you know... And said
that Kiev can't establish any control on this city so far?.... Or maybe it's
regular Russian army there in the city of Donetsk and Ukrainian regular army
cannot even enter into the city? I don't think so... The problem is that
Donbass hates all current Kiev regime and after it did bloody massacre in
Lugansk and surroundings there can't be any United Ukraine anymore.... And the
last, about Crimea. Crimea is a part of Russia, as it was 300 years before and
now and forever... Amen.

there many times, I personally know many of the organizers and many are Jews.
Never saw a single Nazi uniform or symbolic in Maidan. You can check thousand
of hours of real time TV from espresso.tv, gromanske and others and you will
not see any. You named it : it is Russian propaganda. Come in Ukraine and see
for yourself. See how many "Nazis" give free shelter to people they never saw
in their life fleeing from eastern Ukraine, old pensioners in the villages that

@Aleks it is not worth answering: you obiovsly don't know Kyiv, don't know
anyone who was there, never saw any video of what happened both in Kyiv and
Odessa. Why Russian TV was on site in Odessa and pointing the cameras exactly
where the people burnt much before the fire begun? Why the chief of Odessa
police fled to Russia on the next day and his extradiction is refused ?
Regarding Maidan how can people could got shot in the back if the where all in
an upper position that has no sight to Maidan but only from the Government
quarter ? Do you know people in Donetsk? Do you know that there was a
referendum (a real one recognized even by Russia) about the Ukrainian
indipendence and that the majority of people in Donetsk voted for the Ukrainian
State ? Do you know who is fighting there? Do you know that Ukrainian army has
no t90 tanks and that the Grad system used by Russian army in Donetsk have a
different number of wheels than Ukrainian? Do you know that historically
speaking Crimea is of Tatars and not Russian (they controlled Crimea for a few
centuries and were the majority of residents before Stalin sterminated them) ?

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Dmitry: where you got that number? Please read the official reports from
Ukrainian police (that time controlled by Yanykovich) : during all Maidan died
29 policeman in all the country. Some of natural causes, some at crime scenes.

@Katerina : sorry but I speak only about what I see every day and saw with my

lives here in Ukraine (I have a lot of friends in the local Russian community)
about the real situation in the country or you can ask to the journalists that
left Russian tv during last months. You are right that there is a lot of
propaganda both in Ukraine and in Russia and it is a shame and very dangerous

Maidan square was covered by red and black flags of Nazi collaborators. The
second most common flag was of the Social Natonalist (Svoboda) party that was
labeled as fascist by EU and Israel. To say that you didn't see any Nazis on
Maidan is to try really hard not to she the obvious.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Steve the red and black flag is the one of UPA. Calling them Nazi is not
completely correct. They used Nazi help to free the Galician territories but
later fought to free them from Nazis as well and Bandera and his supporters
spent a lot of time in Nazi prisons for that. The political ideas of UPA were
very far from Nazism. That flag was mainly used by Pravu Sektor that was not
allowed in the Square until after the clashes with the police and had to locate
in October palace. By the way the most common flag in the Square was Ukrainian,
followed by UE. When they allowed political parties (late December) it was
followed by Udar and then indeed the Svoboda, but we are talking about a
handful number of flags. There are a lot of fakes on the Internet and Russian
channels showing other things, this is why I mistrust the Internet and the
media. There are a lot of realtime video of local tvs and bloggers that shows
how it really was if you don't trust me. Regarding Svoboda I would just add
that it has been under scrutiny in Europe but recently rehabilitated by the
Jews community, specifically by Mr. Rabbinovich (head of the community in
Ukraine) that in 2013 said that while not sharing the political ideas of
Svoboda found no evidence or hints of racism in the party. Also Europe never
classified Svoboda as Social Nationalist party but as far right. To understand
the extent of the right parties fenomenon in Ukraine you can just look at the
last elections: they got a total of 4 seats in Parlament out of 420. If I'm not
wrong it is the worts right parties result in all Europe and a fraction of
Russia. Many Ministers of interim and current government have Jews origins as
the Prime Minister and many deputies, one of the Presidential candidates was
the head of Jews community and got 3 times more the votes of the far right
candidate. Also I didn't stated that I saw no Nazis in the Square, I said that
there were no Nazi uniforms or flags (to be completly true one time there was
one flag with a svastica that was immediately removed). Indeed some of the
people in the Square had far right ideals (I would however not call them Nazis)
but we are talking of a few hunderds between a total of 100.000 to 700.000
(depending on the meeting day), it seems quite irrelevant. Most of the people
in the Square were students and businessman followed by pensioners.

Don't get me wrong : I don't like Svoboda and was not my intentention to defend
them, just things changes and maybe they have changed as well. In the list
there are most of the parties directly financed by Putin's political party but
I don't think they are a Nazi party, they just do their legitimate political
interests. What I'm sure of is that Svoboda didn't provided much muscles. Pravu
Sektor indeed had a much more active role in the clashes with police and for
this was emarginated by the Euromaidan movement until the very last days when
every force was needed to repeal the police attacks. I also think that there is
something that everyone is missing : it is most Mr. Yanykovich regime (even if
Yanykovich was elected in almost free elections this is not the story of the
Parlament) fault if Euromaidan become so popular between Ukrainians. In my
opinion if Yanykovich just left Euromaidan protest in peace it would have
become the same as the pro-Tymoshenko ones : a few tends in the city center
with no general interest. The night the police beaten the studends the protest
had already lost his grip and would have failed since at that time was mainly a
Kyiv affair (even in Lviv where started the Orange revolution there were only a
few thousands of protesters at that time), but Mr. Yanykovich was terrified of
a new "Orange" Revolution and wanted to show the country who is in charge. He
repeted the same error later in December and after February 12. Even if there
were some external influence (at political level) the escalation of the events
was with no doubt caused by the wrong policies by Mr. Yanykovich that united
Ukraine against a symbol of misconduct.

U can wrap this "revolution" however u wish the USA spent 5bn destabilising
Ukraine through NGOs and other mediums....... and it only kicked off because
Yani secured 15bn from RU and cheaper gas..... the USA was furious...... and
hence maidan was born..... dead bodies is part of the CIA text book
revolution.... why did the head of CIA visit kiev for cookies NO..... because
they lost the crimea and it was wavering in Ukraine........


\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Hahaha Nick Bolton)) you have no clue of our heritage. And if you are talking
abou CIA officials tell me what was 3 generals from FSB and 12 high ranked
officials doing in Kiev ? What was FSB alpha (16 people) were doing in Kiev ?
They stayed on the UA Alpha base outside of Kiev .

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Nick Bolton if you were there you know where the provocators that clashed on
Bankivska are now and came from : Russia. Strangely there is a pending arrest
order for their leader that Russia doesn't fulfill. The fantomatic Nazi party
you are talking about is a well know Cremlin backed organization in Ukraine. If
it is Cia why Russia don't arrest them ? Regarding 2nd world war I would say
that Ukrainians stopped Nazis from taking Russia and not about liberation. You
know how many Ukrainian died defending Russia during 2nd world war? Do you know
how many died in Afghanistan? I know that Russia wants to rewrite history
telling that there was no Holodomor, Ukrainian salvation, distorcing the
reality about KyivRus but it is quite too much. Let's speak about the truth and
not about fantasy. Yanykovich got 15bn from Russia? Really? Officially got only
5bn that never touched Ukrainan banks but finished to finance his ally Firtash
in an offshore account. That was the money Putin paid for Yanykovich not to
sign the UE association agreement. The source is the chief of staff of
Yanykovich and there are transaction evidence. This is also subject of a
warrant arrest but Russia once again is protecting an internationally wanted
criminal. I really hope Mr. Putin pays you very well to post such false
informations.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

@Andrea Bodrati: who the hack are you? What the nonsense you are telling here?
During WW2 Ukraine was Russia and Russia was Ukraine, it was one United folk
and nation. And all were defending the motherland USSR... You are provocateur.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

European Association? What is this, Andrea Bodrati? Explain the preferences and
advantages of Ukraine entering into this association on terms contemplated by
this agreement.... Yanukovich realized that this gonna be the whole Ukrainian
economy dead ... And he wanted only to postpone the entering and trade more
favorable terms and conditions. And why Europe was so insisting on entering
Ukraine into this Association and prohibiting it from simultaneous entering
into so called Custom Union with Russia, ah?

In this conflict both sides are lying. Propaganda and Anti-Propaganda. Who
starts the fire? The role of the western politics and interests are evident ,
but also the one of Russia. All has to do with power. Nothing with democracy.
Neither Eu, USA nor Russia cares about the victims of this conflict-the Ukraine
people. After the so called orange revolution the get another corrupt system
and then again and now-days the same procedure. What one can see is not
revolution ore change of the system for the benefit of the inhabitants. But
nationalists one the one side against nationalist on the other side.

Stefano Morassutti Vitale the video tells nonsense and lies.

Look the first victim. The video tries to tell the people that the person was
shot from behind. But in the same momment it proofs that the shot come from the
front.

the snipers where sitting in buildings wich were unter control of the ukrainian
security units. Only one building what was MAYBE used as a sniper spot was
under control of the protesters.. the Hotel Ukrainia. But it was not totally
under control of them. Im absolutle suere that they didn't checked EVERY room
on this big hotel. And for snipers it is a normal tactic to take place behind
"enemies" lines or bettween enemies.

\iusr{Ксения Зайцева}

Third force does not necessary means CIA, could be Kremlin as easily (and more

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Aleks: Well if you call the Russian occupation of Ujraine (was a different
territory than today) and the deaths of Ukrainian partisans fighting (not only
with Russia) for their independence, one Nation then I understand why you see
in the same people fighting today in the Donbass fascists. I hoped that almost
one hundered years was enough to call the things with their names and recognize
what a mistake was the sssr but maybe I'm wrong.


\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Aleks: personally I'm against of UE association and think that it is a wrong
path for Ukraine, as it is Nato so I can't say what is good. The right path of
Ukraine in my opinion is to be neutral and a middle zone between the east and
west. Unfortunately the Ukrainian have a different idea and this is what
matters. They are an indipendent Nation and have the right to choose their
path.

\iusr{Ник Болтон}
Lol Gaby..... Pleasant water boarding or the odd broom stick in the popper to brighten your day

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Rene Norton Really Berkut was not shooting ? I saw them myself opening fire
with a rifle and during that infamous day and multiple journalists (Ukrainian
and International) showed that live. During the ongoing investigation more than
20 Berkut officiers admitted that they trasmitted the order to open fire on the
people to their squad. The question is not who fired (even the Russian TV never
stated that Berkut didn't fired) but who fired and killed and that is still
under investigation. Berkut says that there were Alpha units (SBU), Alpha that
was Berkut. One thing is sure : the shooting was coming from the front. If you
wish I can make you speak with persons that got shot and had the bullet proof
vest hit in the front or you can read the medics referees.


\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Gaby Brik : American is not much better than Russia but this is not the point,
the point is what happened in Maidan and what the Ukrainian wants (they are an
Indipendent Nation maybe a few of you forgot). Surely Russia had a lot of
influence in Yanykovich and USA has a lot of influence in some political
parties of current Government as it happens in many other countries in the
world but once again it is not the point.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Nick Bolton : Ukraine is now as beautiful as before if we exclude the Donbass.
One really strange thing about this country is that if you walk 50 km. from the
war it seems to be in an absolutely normal State. Have you had been in Kyiv or
Lviv or Dnipropetrosk recently ? The resturants are full, most of the hotel and
private apartments room where booked as the old times. In Lviv city center this
month alone they opened 12 new restaurants and cafe, renovated 5 trolley bus
cars and 1 hospital. Unfortunately the situation in the occupied Donbass is
tragic and everyone hopes that soon the soldiers will be able to come back home
and the poor people that couldn't left the war zone can have a decent life.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Nick Botton : It is true that there are a lot of power interruptions due to
cut of coal supplies from Donbass but not true about apartment rental (it is my
family business). For sure it is not sweetness and roses in ua, exactly as it
was before and Ukraine is still as beautiful as before.

\iusr{Ник Болтон}
Are u talking kiev apartment rental or kiev ?

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Nick Button : I'm not earning as an expat and I know exactly how the life of
Ukrainians is: it was hard, it is hard and it will be hard in the near future
but the life is not much better or much worst than 1 year ago for much of the
Ukrainians. If they didn't made the revolution it would be maybe a little bit
better but liberty has no price.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

I'm talking of Kyiv rental market and not about a specific company. I can speak
about at least 3 different companies (one owns 38 apartments) that increased by
more than 10\% the reservations this holiday season. The most important renting
portal has only 54 apartments available for the 3-7 January period (most
outside city center) out of almost 2000. In Lviv the things are even better and
it was impossible to find an apartement already a few weeks ago out of about
700. Of course I'm speaking about the domestic market, companies working with
international customers are facing an hard time due to the ongoing war.

\iusr{Lida Zinko}

@Steve Poe - If you think the people on Maidan were Nazi collaborators, I have
to say that they must be pretty sprightly for 90 year olds... Seriously, it's
like saying that all of Germans are Nazis, a statement no one could have gotten
away with anytime, anywhere. Maybe it's time for Ukraine to start bringing
Russia and their sympathizers on charges for inciting hatred. How can anyone
seriouslyreduce every serious discussion when these inflammatory statements are
always tossed around? Yeah, everyone hated Yanukowych and wanted hi out, but
Ukrainians deserved him and have no right to un-corrupt government because
they're nazis... Yeah, Ukrainians deserved to have chunks of land annexed by
Russians, becsue they're nazis... They deserved to have a war staged in the
East with para militaryRussian mercenaries because they're nazis. ... on and on

Especially that Russia has highest concentration of Neo Nazis in the world:

it?

\iusr{Jimmy Garst}

The paid propagandists in the legion of flying monkeys are out in force. Andrea
is a greedy fascist who would sell his soul for a dollar... The narrative on
Ukraine being told by Washington and America's fascist owned media monopoly is
a total lie. The first lie is the accusation of Russian aggression and Western
expansion. The USA broke it's treaties with Russia when it brought Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Georgia and Moldova into NATO, aka the North Atlantic
Terrorist organization. This is Eastern expansion by the West. 

Russia drew the line in the sands of the Dniper, and Washington crossed that
line. When CIA backed Nazi like Julia Timoshenko who said she wanted to kill
all Russians, the annexation of Crimea was necessary to secure Russian nukes at
it's base in Crimea and protect ethic Russians who have long wanted to re-unify
with Russia.. A matter of national security. Putin kept the nukes out of the
hands of Nazi and avoided a nuclear war. 

Additionally, Washington has broken treaties by sending nuclear armed ships
into the Sea. The so called Russian invasion was a total fabrication. FYI,
Washington forgot the lessons of the American revolution. No imperialist army
will defeat a revolutionary gorilla army of people defending their homes. The
opposition in the East to Nazi rule only escalated when the Nazi bombed babies
and baboshkas forcing men to take up arms. 

The next big lie is that the USA is not supporting Nazi. Ukraine has a long
history of anti-Semite and Nazi collaboration. 20 million Russians died
defeating the Nazi, the CIA couldn't have picked a better group to start WWIII
with Russia than the Ukrainian Nazi. 

In 2012, the FBI reported that \$3 billion was embezzled from American bank
accounts and smuggled into Ukraine. This year we learned that the NSA had the
technology and the CIA had developed methods to avoid airport security.
Protesters at the Maidain were being paid by shadow groups. McCain visited the
protest to check on the investment. 2+2=5 don't ya know, cos big brother tells
us so. The CIA has conducted 50 fascist coups in 50 years, and if you think the
CIA was not behind the fascist coup in Kiev; then, you are a myopic fool. I
have been attacked my the fascist for telling the truth. Now Oliver Stone is
doing a documentary and adds another chapter to the Untold Story of American
history. If one applies simple logic to the downing of MH17, it is clear that
was a CIA false flag operation. Although the truth is obvious, the West sticks
to the lie. The fascist coup in in Ukraine was all about bringing Ukraine into
NATO. A majority of Ukrainian people do not want NATO or the IMF. Forcing NATO
onto the people of Ukraine is the very definition of fascism. Washington should
be planning his retreat; but, now plans to ship arms from Afghanistan to
Ukraine. More of what they call Russian aggression. 

It is a sad day in America when a Nazi is welcomed into the White House, can
speak before Congress and be given billions to commit war crimes, conduct a
civil war and advance Washington's WWIII. Sanctions are the path to war, and
Washington is on the war path. Today, the militarism in the USA goes far beyond
defense and is all about fascism and imperialism. American militarism rivals
Nazi Germany and has morally and financially bankrupt America. 

Now Americans are being promised \$1 trillion more in new nukes. Feel Safer
Now? The fascist owned media monopolies are selling nothing but lies, our Big
Brother propaganda machine rivals that of the Nazi. As the fascist paid
propagandist on yahoo comment boards, aka the legion of flying monkeys, want
you to believe that RT is the propaganda machine. America is rapidly becoming
the Fourth Reich. Washington is just a huge fascist pig farm of red and blue
pigs all owned by K Street. Time for real change. Time to stop the perpetual
war machine run by the good old boy club. They are all criminals in DC. They
have sided with Nazi, funded ISIS, are talking with Raul and would be friends
of the devil if it advanced their war against the evil empire. If that ain't
the kettle calling the pot black. The fascists in DC seek revolution in Russia;
while progressive Americans think we need revolution here in America. They are
all criminals in DC. Vote No Incumbent!!

@Petra, agree that Andrea is a Troll spewing propaganda. It really cracked me
up when she wrote that Russians were the snipers. ROFL at that one.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Sharon : I never wrote that. Indeed I wrote that even If there were FSB agents
on the ground I can't believe that they shot and most probably it was either
Berkut or Alpha units and there is a on going investigation and let's wait for
the results.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Jimmy : I just wrote what I saw. As I said I have no sympaty for Nato and
think the Ukraine will do wrong joyining it but this has nothing to do with
this thread! We are talking about what happened in Maidan and what Ukrainian
people wants. When you say that I'm a fascist you only prove that you have no
real arguments to debate.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Modari Console: what you write shows that you have no knowledge of Ukraine and
Ukrainian people at all. You think that everything is economics or money but
Ukrainian in Maidan were not fighting for that: they were fighting for justice
and liberty not for the UE, USA or Russia. I don't argue on the fact that they
still risk to loose, they won indipendence from Russia but the corruption is
still high in the country and the risk of becoming financial slaves is still
high.


\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@westler joe : you know that the symbol you showed in your post is the araldyc

since resemble Nazi or maybe they are terrible Nazis as well?

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

I think we have gone too far with things that have nothing to do with this
thread so I will end as I started asking Mr. Stone to seek the real thruth and
not the one that his financing Ukraianian olygracs are looking for. Please ask
Ukrainian people in Kyiv, policemans, Maidan students, check the realtime
videos shot by Espresso TV, check the presence of FSB on the ground. Thank you
very much!


\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Wrestler Joe : The symbol you mention is used in the contest of Lviv Oblast
administration, maybe Lviv Oblast itself is a symbol of hatred ? Just to

since most of the Government members and the prime Minister are Jews ?


\iusr{J.V. Ayson}

The government that was currently installed in Ukraine is a pro-imperialist and
fascist in character and orientation. It is not elected, but installed by the
US.

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@John Victor Ayson : The government was not installed but voted by the large
majority of elected Deputies it is quite different. That said it would be
interesting to know which act of imperialism made the gurrent government since,
as far as I can see from the Rada website there is no any Legislative act that
could hint of that. Or are you saying that having a pro-western policy uquals
to being pro-imperialist ? Would it not be worst being pro-Russia (that occupy
different States territory and have a very imperialist military doctrine
speaking even about that infamous "zone of influence" that lead to the WWI ?).
Would it not be better to remain neutral as it was before ?


\iusr{Lily Goncharova-Maher}

@ Andrea Bodrati " Please be so kind to speak with the people in Donetsk and

@Lilia : no doubt that there are poor people dying on both part and it is a

families of the dead Ukrainian and Russian soldiers! But there is only Russian
backed militants and their mastermind Putin that invaded Ukraine to blame.
Please stop looking at Russian TV propoganda and talk with the people! I speak
with my relatives and friends in Donetsk, in Lugansk quite often (when the
lines or Internet ar working) and even if they are bombarded by Russian TV they
see exactly what is happening: militants get inside their apartments, hospitals
and make firing points risking the life of the peoples living there. They have
almost nothing to eat, the new Russian backed Government doesn't pay almost any
social contribution (1000 UAH in the last 5 months) and it is only thanks to
Ukrainian Government that didn't stop gas and electricity (with some
interruptions indeed) if they are not freezing. Speak with the people who fled

Poroshenko is the most corrupt man in Ukraine and a war criminal and murderer
(much worse than Yanukovich)! There is almost one million refugees who fled to
Russia from your fascist regime in Kiev. Did you speak to them? I doubt it. Mr
Soros sponsored the violent coup in Maidan and stupid bloodthirsty people like
you- are continuing to LIE and support the killing of innocent civilians in
Eastern Ukraine. That the truth which you DO NOT WANT TO HEAR - because you
only care about the "democracy" for the Ukrainian nazis as a typical russophob!
