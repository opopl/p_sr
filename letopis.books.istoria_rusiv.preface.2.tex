In Kiev Russia, there have been plenty of Historians and Chronicle Writers of
this period of time.

But as this country, as if created or doomed to ruin from frequent invasions of
strangers, and even more frequent assaults and siches from the peoples of
neighboring and, ultimately, from inscessant strife and beatings suffered all
sorts of plundering, destruction and all-burning and, so to speak, filled and
covered with human blood and sprinkled with ashes, then in such an unfortunate
Land was it possible to keep anything intact?

Therefore, for this reason, we took this History from the chronicles and notes
of White Russia, the country of the same blood and being distant from the ruins
of Kiev Russia.
