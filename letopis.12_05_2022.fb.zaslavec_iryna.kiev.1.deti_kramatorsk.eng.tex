While he was guarding things in the station premises, a rocket flew into the platform where mother and sister were.
There is a phrase "heart breaking" but it is inconsistent with what you feel when you enter their ward. Three beds. On one is a 11-year-old girl yana with amputovanimi legs. In front is mom Natalia. She doesn't walk either: the left leg is amputated, the right is injured. On the third bed - 11-Year-old Yaroslav. He and his sister are twins.
Yaroslavčik is not an adult by age. He was the only survivor of that tragedy and took on the responsibility of caring for his mother and sister. Bring water, help get dressed, run to the store.. The kid is doing it all honestly. He is now a hold up.
Natalia cries from time to time. Not for yourself, for the children. For calamity physical and mental. He says he will never forgive himself for going out with his daughter on the tea platform distributed by volunteers. For not staying indoors, not saving...
30 wounded in kramatorsʹku at the station kids for the last month brought only to our children's hospital st. Nikolai Перше медичне об'єднання міста Львова . Everyone's story is a solid pain. Ward by ward is calamity, death of relatives, fear... There's a girl who lost there mom. She hides under the blanket whenever they come in..
I want these children’s stories to get out to the world! So that no one else has any doubt that such pure evil is. So that no one else dares to call conflict what kills and maims children!!!
