About emotional swings and the secrets of optimism.\par
One \enquote{day off} from the life of the mayor.\par
...\par
Tonight is a rough night for us.\par
Didn't sleep, didn't rest, shook from the whistle and rattle.\par
Once again.\par
...\par
And in the morning everyone, although with a pops mood, but returned to their affairs.\par
And I after another insomnia went to welcome our slavetnu zenítnu rocket brigadu.\par
Because the boys and girls celebrated her 31st anniversary today, and we have long agreed on this meeting.\par
Imagine that at night dníprovs неkí defenders of the sky shot down 9 Russian missiles (! ) and the 3 shaheds (!! ), and you see the faces of these heroes with your own eyes in the morning (!!! )\par
There were about two hundred people in the hall who worked without a break this night. Tired but determined.\par
They simply did the impossible.\par
Once again.\par
...\par
And then you realize that in front of you are those who provide you with life, health, the opportunity to work and do something useful.\par
And that they are incredible titans that somehow miraculously found themselves in our world.\par
And when the one who has personally turned the main weapon of Russian terror into scrap comes to the award, you know that's a normal looking man.\par
One you could easily meet in the supermarket yesterday.\par
Then we spoke for a long time with the commander, who was completely unknown when he was resting normally.\par
Because the same people are around you.\par
They get tired but they never give up.\par
You calm down and your mood gets better.\par
Once again.\par
...\par
And the next moment you're already going to the private sector, where a missile hit.\par
And all your cheerful optimism disappears into a meter-long funnel with burnt cars, broken houses and fallen flower beds all around.\par
But its people around you again.\par
And they need confidence in support, no matter how hard their situation is.\par
...\par
So you finally get yourself together and come back to town for the angry birds exhibition.\par
Here you meet Ruslana, your good acquaintance since the ancient times of Maidan.\par
And Maria Berlin, and dozens more developers who moved here from all over the country and are ready to work higher forces for success on the front.\par
...\par
By the way, the Dnieper City Hall is ready to provide its support.\par
We will develop mechanisms to invest in the mass production of FPV drones.\par
You say it, and the soul is somehow lighter again.\par
...\par
So what's the secret.\par
The emotional swing will not get tired of you soon.\par
This is a fact.\par
But when you're sad or hard, you must always remember that you're not alone.\par
And even from nepidjomnoí̈ fatigue can save simple human communication.\par
Because talking to one person can help dozens of others.\par
And telling about your misery is to get support from where you don't expect.\par
There are always people who are around. Just have to go out and look around.\par
...\par
...\par
R. S. Thank you very much the commander of the air force of zsu Nikolai olíšchuk for the chest sign \enquote{for the assistance of the air forces of Ukraine}.\par
This is an award for our entire City.\par
