Walking around the city for two months, you already know all its cracks.
Somewhere there was no asphalt before the war, and somewhere there was a "Grad"
- and we need to go around. Somewhere tanks were going - which means, the
wheels will "sing", somewhere the equipment was burning - and there is no upper
layer. Somewhere the debris is still being taken apart, and somewhere they
can't cut it because there are blocks.

And on Sumyskaya St., in one place - with a 20 meter difference, two flights in
the same place. I remember them well: the first I turned the volunteers car
over, during the second I was nearby.

When you go - and you already know: first you will have to accept to the right,
then - to the left. But yesterday I looked - but there are no familiar pits.
Fresh asphalt instead of them. And all thanks to these guys, the communal
heroes, who are flying our city under shelling.

Guys, we'll even forgive you to repair roads in the rain now! And pizza is as
small as we can.
