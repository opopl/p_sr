Today I listened to one interception of the SBU, there is the wife of the occupier who lives in the border city where Ukrainian children are forcibly taken out, at first it does not matter that the children refused to draw this Colorado abomination until May 9 and said that it is not their s vâto and symbolism, and then says what should have been done to them: stab dope, cut stars on genitals and kill. The occupant himself in this conversation is clearly not too comfortable.
But it's all about the nature of violent asvabadítêlʹstva.
There's this firing hero syndrome you should honor and pray for for getting fired.
And pray for the heroine-mother, who allowed you, little Nazi beast, into your territory.
Being thankful and praying for being taken without your consent and often without parents into foreign territory. Because it was released, because it was security territory! So you have to fold odes, fold your hands in prayer and not hang yourself.
They don't think, don't understand, don't want to know, that they destroy the child's identity, force her to live by someone else's rules, force her to renounce her culture, force her because she didn't come here consciously and freely.
The same violent nature of a liberator, is when a woman is given a choice in an occupied city, the violence on you will be silent because I am a hero not a scum because I will give you and your Nazi family protection because you see I like you ichna, and let's live in such a way that you accept it, appreciated and I will love you. To love yourself, what kind of violence is this? Love and a treat of privilege!
Because it's like I love you, because I do a lot for you, different rules than the rest, so why you don't appreciate it, why you flirt, why do you prove, bitch, me to the point that I have to resort to violence?!
I didn't mean it, I brought you good, what do you do? You deny it, you don't accept it, such ingratitude bitch. So teach you, teach the mind, gratitude and respect. Teach through violence and humiliation if you don't accept love and release. Proved it and got it.
