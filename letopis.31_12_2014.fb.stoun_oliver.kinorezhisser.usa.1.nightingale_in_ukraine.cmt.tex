Bravo Oliver.... I salute you for your courage and intelligence in understanding
the real truth. Please help all of us.... thank you.


\iusr{Сергей Мельниченко}
Mr. Stone.

1. Any American police will tell you that any non-serial killing, which has not
been investigated in hot pursuit will not ever investigated.

In addition. Third party could be the FSB.

2. Poles and Jews have an opinion different from that says the Soviet-Russian
propaganda. Ask the Poles and the Jews who lived in Poland and Ukraine.

3. The Cold War 2.0 began with the annexation of the Crimea from Ukraine.

\iusr{Andrea Chalupa}

You are lying to your fans, Mr Stone. An investigation is ongoing; I know
because I was recently in Kyiv talking to people involved. Sorry Ukraine isn't
moving fast enough for you; it's fighting an invasion by Putin and a collapsed
economy thanks to Yanukovych and his circle stealing an estimated \$70 billion.

Social media helped fuel the revolution; for instance, Ukrainians in the
diaspora around the world could watch Ukrainians in Kyiv being beaten and shot
on multiple livestream news feeds; and in response they organized twitter
storms and facebook storms putting pressure on world leaders to act and on
journalists to cover protesters being killed fighting for Democracy in Ukraine.

The US/EU tried to get protesters to sign a truce with Yanukovych, letting him
stay in power, but the protesters refused and threatened to storm his palace if
he didn't leave by the following morning; Yanukovych fled town the next
morning. Maidan succeeded despite the West, not because of it. If the
protesters had listened to the US/EU then your buddy Yanukovych would still be
living large in his palace paid for by stolen tax dollars. Shame on you for
lying to your fans!!! Come to Ukraine, meet with journalists and scholars and
reform leaders, or are you too scared of your alternative reality being
shattered and of losing your film funding?

\iusr{Anton Shekhovtsov}

Oliver Stone may be critical of the US policies, but his orientalist approach
towards the Ukrainians, whom he is depriving of any agency, reveals typical
American racism. He is essentially an American supremacist, of the worst kind,
because he combines a belief in the omnipotence of the US with self-indulgent
American guilt.

\iusr{Michael Carrier}

I have family in Ukraine, and they are deeply offended at your patronising view
that this a US driven protest. This is rather an out growth of democratic
protest by the young generation who want to end corruption and kleptocracy.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Oleksiy Babansky}

so, Soros must have been financing the corrupt cleptocratic govt in Ukraine,
because THEY had been the prime reason for unrest and crisis.

It's like, you would have a bad knee, but instead of advising you to go to the
doctor I would blame you for rocking the boat in favor of the USA. "Soros paid
you to injure your knee so that you destabilize our otherwise great nation with
false accusations!"

Yes, what you say is exactly THAT kind of absurd.

\iusr{Oleksiy Babansky}

It's so funny how pro-Moscow voices blame the US but completely avoid talking
about the sheer depravity and corruption of the cleptocratic marionettes who
rob and bleed the country dry BEFORE the crisis starts.

So convenient...

You have no conscience Mr. Stone for not thoroughly documenting the truth! Your
comments, thoughts of history and plans for this movie is a huge lie and
disservice to millions of people and you should seriously think about this and
your reputation!!! All who know the truth will not allow your heinous attempt
to make your profit on the souls of the Ukrainian nation and all its ethnic/non
ethnic citizens along with its worldwide diaspora that knows Ukraine's history
well better than you! You have not made any attempts to contact the "experts"

\iusr{Svitlana Tuchynska}

The truth is much simpler, Mr. Stone. (As it often is) Ukrainians have chosen
European path, just as their neighbors from Poland, Romania, Moldova and Baltic
states have before. But Putin, with his fantasies of bringing back to life
Russian empire/USSR just could not take it. The US, Europe, and other factors
probably played some role, but the core is just that simple. Talk about black
cats and dark rooms.

Volunteers organize using FB because there is no other means for people to get
organized against corruption and Kremlin's hand on Ukraine, only social media.
You did not live in former USSR for years and cannot imagine the strength of
Kremlin's propaganda all those years and its attempts to still control minds
now, like it was behind Iron curtain. My husband was accused of being paid by
CIA for supporting Ukraine but I know his motives are my family in Ukraine.
Hundreds of people in Ireland self-organized on FB to support Ukraine, we were
inspired by Ukrainians standing against corruption and Kremlin's hand on
Ukraine. No one paid for organising us. We are donating and collecting money
for sending help to Ukraine because we care. We started our FB groups and saw
them growing; social media unites people who care.

\iusr{Kostyantyn Bazhenov}

This is all very interesting, albeit not very true, but why are you not equally
interested in the crimes of the Russians, how they invaded Ukraine through
Crimea, how they invaded the East of Ukraine, with their trained mercenary
groups, which brings back the memory of the Soviet coup in Afghanistan, how the
Russians were shooting at their own peacekeepers in South Ossetia, in order to
start an invasion of Georgia in 2008. You should examine your facts before you
jump to conclusions. The patterns of Russian organized violence, terrorism and
coups is very clear in Ukraine as well. Have you considered that the shooters
could be Russians?

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

As for corruption - Ukraine had a series of extraordinarily corrupt
governments. Both pro-Western and pro-Russian.

Timoshenko could go mile-per-mile against Yanukovich any day - the Gas
Princesse become a billionaire stealing gas, and is widely believed to have
eliminated numerous competitors - with extreme prejudice.

None of this justifies a foreign sponsored coup d'etat which has torn the
country to shreds. Like Libya, like Syria, like Iraq, The Empire saw them as
mere political pawns to be played with at will - and if the situation of the
locals went from bad to catastrophic - that is no real concern to those hand
which are moving the pieces.

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

You, sir, are speaking the truth to people who are used to living on a diet of
lies. Of course they rebel at the suggestion that their entire world-view has
been hideously distorted by the tame corporate media. Please do not apologise
for anything!

\begin{itemize} % {

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

This post is even more pathetic then your first one... CIA was established in
1947... so 2 years into existence they already operating outside of USA during
WW2?? As somebody said "you have great problems with logic"

If on the territory of our country there were military presence of a foreign
country than i blame Yanukovich for it as he destroyed our defense ministry and
let FSB takeover. Don't be ridiculous mr. Stone you have no clue what you are
writing.

It is a silly logical mistake to think that it is impossible for the CIA to
have done this two years into their career. The fact that the CIA was young
doesn't make the fact impossible.

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Do you actually know what was going on during WW2?? The fact that they
presumably supported something during the war in the war zone is a great
speculation..

You are commenting my post) not vise versa so please be gone))

\iusr{Andrew Joseph}

CIA was the OSS under a different name so you are hopelessly unaware of things.
OSS was around since 1942 so not only was the CIA around (albeit under a
different name) since 1942 at the most conservative estimation, but to claim
that an existence of 5 years would preclude what Mr. Stone claimed is
absolutely ludicrous. Don't debate people with brains - we know the reality.

\iusr{Ксения Зайцева}
\textbf{Andrew Kahn}, have you watched "Usual Suspects"? It is a good movie. You might recognize yourself in agent Kujan.

much difference as for intelligence service to work you need network ..for that
you need time..the rest speculation)

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

And how you create network during WAR?

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Regime change is one thing.. but to declare that they've been doing it since
1947 is a little to much for my taste. Again I don't care weather they were
involved in euromaydan. What happened was right thing to happen .. The
consequences were unpredictable...

\iusr{Caroline Muzyka McCrea}

could to keep a big bon fire going. Seriously, is this what you believe!!!!
People protest all over the world for different reasons. Is the CIA and the
west behind them too.

\iusr{Vira Dziedzic}

Sergiy, Russia employs thousands to spread their own propaganda, Stone,
obviously, ever eager to bash USA, got payed a hefty sum to create his
"masterpiece"about the CIA involvement. Anyway, most of the people you are

sides, and bandera is no hero at all. Ukraine needs to drop his name.

yes... but havent you done some bad things in your life??

sergei you are a gullible, naive person, and possibly stupid, like you said

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Scott Kuli : I agree that Crimea is the only territory in Ukraine that is
mostly inhabitated by Russian ethnics but the fact the Crimean people don't
want to live under the Kyiv Government (funny once again a Government which has
a Jews Prime Minister and most of his member Jews is often labeled as Nazi) is
just an opnion (on my point of view it is true indeed) since no real referendum
was ever made (the one who took place was a joke, I have friends that voted few
times even not being Ukrainian). Problem is that there is the international law
and one Nation simply can't invade another one due to the fact in a part of his
territory lives their ethnics. Following this rule Austria could invade a part
of Italy, Italy a part of France and Slovenia, Serbia a part of Kosovo, Albania
a part of Greece, Poland the Western Ukraine, Turkey a part of Iraq and so with
a very long list. Regarding the other territories occupied by Russia I suggest
you to take a walk in Donetsk, Lygansk or, even better, Novoazovsk. It is full
of Russian military equipment and you will also find a lot a people from
Russia, Cecenia, Ossetia. You can also ask the Ukrainian living there if you
know any or can just check the OSCE and UN reports about the number of Russian
militants and equipments everyday illegally crossing the border. Since the
military personel don't loose the status even during license and that you can't
find a T90 or a BM27 at the shop near your home we can say that the Russian
army is well inside Ukraine. Even the former "Minister of Defence" of the DNR
was a colonel of the Russian Army.

\iusr{Lily Goncharova-Maher}

@ Sergiy Stakhovsky. Yanukovic maybe was corrupt but he wasn't a murderer
unlike your new oligarch Poroshenko (the most corrupt man in Ukraine!) who
killing innocent civilians in Donbass. So... the Odessa massacre also doesn't
worry you? No wonder that people in Crimea voted to go back to Russia otherwise
your Ukranian nationalists would bomb then as well as Donetsk or Slaviansk. Do
you want "democracy"only for Ukrainian Nazis? Hypocrite!

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Lilia, start to write about something you know... i was in Slaviansk and i saw
how was it there. Murderer?? you mean russian special ops taking gov. buildings
and give weapons to drugaddicts and drunk psychopaths... altho they didnt last
for long so putin had to move in regular army.. otherwise we would be living in
peace.

\iusr{Piotr Chmurnik}

Until 1897 most of them in Crimea Crimean Tatars (36\%) vs. 33\% of Russians.
Only murder of Tatars and their deportation from Crimea and Russians settle in
the time of Stalin's proportions have changed. Membership Crimea to Ukraine
confirmed signed on December 8, 1991 at the city of Minsk. Signed by Yeltsin.
Crimea referendum was illegal. Confirmed the Venetian commission.

\iusr{Daniel Rajala}

Why is the bullshit about ancient CIA practises relevant in present crisis? Yes
US was involved in escalation of Ukraine's crisis but above all the main
culprit and manipulator has been Russia, it has been evident that on all major
levels Ukraine has been undermined by Russian agents, puppeteers, and kept
deliberately as a Russian buffer region against west and above all abused and
taken advantage of.

The EU and even USA care more about the human rights and freedom of speech and
civil liberties that Russia's regime of authoritarian kleptocrats that jail
their political opposition, occasionally murder and often beat them senseless.
This cold war 2.0 was started by Russia instigating the civil war in Donbass
and illegal annexation of Crimean peninsula. No way west will accept this kind
of occupation of a region of an independent country. I can only hope and am
certain the sanctions will be escalated and tightened and they will last for
years to come. What is certain is Russia suffers more from economic ties
getting broken than EU or USA, and more likely end up a subordinate to China as
a result of this. Good luck with that.

\iusr{William P Sheehe}

Odessa Massacre was a Russian covert operation to incite civil unrest, which
failed, presumably because the hired operatives were simply out-numbered by the
pro-Ukraine football crowd. Try again, Lilia.

William P. Sheehe- Odessa Massacre had nothing to do with Russians, please do
not lie! It was sponsored and orchestrated by oligarch Kolomoiskij. I hope he
is not the main sponsor of Sergey Stakhovky! Blood of innocent victims on his

@ Sergiy Stakhovsky . Please don't patronize me, I have friends and relatives

cheap anti-Russian propaganda won't wash with me! Kolomoiskij organised the
Odessa massacre!

Poroshenko is the most corrupt man in Ukraine and a war criminal and murderer!
Much worse than Yanukovich ever was! There are almost one million refugees who
fled to Russia from your fascist regime in Kiev. George Soros sponsored the
violent coup in Maidan and stupid bloodthirsty people like you are continuing
to LIE and support the killing of innocent women and children in Eastern
Ukraine. That is the truth which you DO NOT WANT TO HEAR - because as a typical

We are all living in ONE SMALL PLANET CALLED- the EARTH!!! If God wants me to

Very correct.. and believe me I am living according to it.. unlike you(judging my

\iusr{Georgiy Levchuk}

Linda Green - by the way, Lviv, the most tolerable city, based on your

you. Just go there, talk to people, Russian or English, - unless you believe
ITAR-TASS that they would crucify you first, then drug you, then use you for
target practice, then cut your head off, then force you to sing Ukrainian
national anthem, then eat your kids and force you to eat them too, and then to
top it off - speak to you in Ukrainian, and after speak to you in Russian -
probably to make you lose your mind. Oh, wait, you don't have one... oops

OK, you know what? Believe what you want, guys - Russia is bad, Putin is bad,

We don't care. Russia has been nothing but an ally to the US in the past couple

this - Ukraine is not worth risking a world war over. OK? I don't care if you
don't like it. Deal with it! Fight if you want, but don't look at us - it is

\iusr{Natali Walker}

Sergiy Stakhovsky... It looks like you are the one who has problems with logic
and know nothing about CIA and its history. If you believe that the US started
collecting information and conducting covert operations only after CIA's
official establishment, you should do more readings on this matter. Even CIA's
official website says that the "United States has carried out intelligence
activities since the days of George Washington, but only since World War II
have they been coordinated on a government-wide basis."

\iusr{Edmund Dantes}

Sergiy, you are an ignorant troll. The CIA was created by a name change of the
OSS (office of Strategic Services) which existed in the army during WWII. It
gave us such raving maniacs as Ed Lansdale, the first army intelligence officer
to discover the existance of Yamashita's gold and considered by Col Fletcher
Prouty to be one of the architects of the JFK murder. You should educate
yourself to prevent making more false representation of facts.

\iusr{William P Sheehe}

Jay, your deluded rantings are laughable, and tardy. The US has already
committed \$300 M over 3 years, to assist Ukraine's self-defense vs. the

Don't let the Western MSM rewrite history to whitewash the genocidal Stephen
Bandera, OUN, and the UPA - and those who worship at their obscene cult in
Ukraine to excuse the nature of the Maidan Putsch and regime.

"Abstract

During the past decade, particularly under the presidency of the third
Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko (2005–2010) there have been repeated
attempts to turn the leading ﬁgures of the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists (OUN)and its armed wing, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) into
national heroes. As these fascist organizations collaborated with the Nazi
Germany, carried out ethnic cleansing and mass murder on a massive scale, they
are problematic symbols for an aspiring democracy with the stated ambition to
join the European Union. Under Yushchenko, several institutes of memory
management and myth making were organized, a key function of which was to deny
or downplay OUN-UPA atrocities. Unlike many other former Soviet republics, the
Ukrainian government did not need to develop new national myths from scratch,
but imported ready concepts developed in the Ukrainian diaspora. Yushchenko’s
legitimizing historians presented the OUN and UPA as pluralistic and inclusive
organizations, which not only rescued Jews during the Holocaust, but invited
them into their ranks to ﬁght shoulder to shoulder against Hitler and Stalin.
This mythical narrative relied partly on the OUN’s own post-war forgeries,
aimed at cover up the organization’s problematic past. As employees of the
Ukrainian security services, working out of the ofﬁces of the old KGB, the
legitimizing historians ironically dismissed scholarly criticism as Soviet
myths. The present study deals with the myth-making around the OUN, the UPA,
and the Holocaust, tracing their diaspora roots and following their migration
back and forth across the Atlantic."

Your first post is completely incorrect. WW2 ended in 1945, and yes CIA from
the very beginning operated outside of the United states. Yanukovych did not
destroy any defence ministry whatsoever, there was no external threat to
Ukraine until November 2013. The fact you cannot even bother to answer any of
the things that Oliver Stone has said and instead resort to ad hominem attacks
against him really does show that you don't have a clue about what happened in
Ukraine and you support the Nazi and openly fascistic elements which toppled

... you made a valid point about the need for a network for an intelligence

absolutely valid based on those concerns, but I'm going to go out on a limb and
assume you don't know what the Gehlen Organisation was? Or the other stay
behinds recruited from 1945 onwards?

In fact, those very SS officers, that the CIA brought into their umbrella were
one and the same that had managed the Nachtangale battalion. And they did
nearly the same thing in every Western European country.

having ukrainian blood has nothing to do with understanding Ukrainians. There
were many russian, jewish, muslim Ukrainians that fought for their rights to
live in democracy free from corruption. there are many "pure blooded
ukrainians" than would sell their country for bigger pension.

\iusr{Vira Dziedzic}

why do you think I or anyone else forget??? we don't! thants why we had Majdan,
so that the people in government would never forget who, by Constitution ch5,
is in charge of the country. we have to work with what we have. when we get
better qualified, we hire them (economists from abroad !!!). But at the end new
government knows, if they mess up, they will end up like Yanik. That my friend
is democracy! and that is what Majdan was all about. the rest is a hard way...
there will be many mistakes and fails, democracy is hard. I just wish Russia
would back off and let us be and let us build our own country, mistakes and
successes, but on our own terms.

\iusr{Vira Dziedzic}

You contradict yourself again. We don't live in the shadow of Russia, we are
invaded by Russia and our territory is annexed by Russia. We have been in the
neutral zone all the time trying to work with both sides. That is why when
Yanukovich ran away and Russia annexed Crimea, we felt as if out old friend put
the knife in our back. People couldn't believe they could do it to us, if
volunteers wouldn't pick up guns to protect the east, there would be no Ukraine
by now. We feel betrayed by Russia. They signed the treaty to protect our
borders in 1996 in exchange for us giving them all of our nuclear weapons. They
broke their own treaty. We don't stand a chance to fight them back
alone.meanwhile Russian politicians keep talking about wiping us out as a
nation sending Russian troops and tanks to the east. What would you suggest we
should do? Capitulate? Give up, after all these years of independence, many
deaths during the revolution? What would you do? Idk. It's futile to explain.
Ukrainians are free in their hearts. Ukraine is Not Russia. We will fight to
the end. For our freedom.

had the impression that it was all done by "Victoria Nuland, John McCain etc."
because these are the folks you have seen on CNN, than you are just saying that
you have no idea what has actually going on there.

\end{itemize} % }

\iusr{Bohdan Pechenyak}

Oliver, you are completely out of your depth and it is just painfully obvious.
"The bigger picture" you talk about is some KGB-produced myth you have eaten up
like Putin's lapdog, I"m sorry to say.

Just a few facts. The "Nightingale" battalion existed - but it existed in early
1940s, being disbanded by 1942. And it had absolutely nothing to do with USA or
CIA (which did not even exist back then). You can't even get that little fact
right, not to mention the so-called "bigger picture".

"CIA parachuted Ukrainian infiltrators"? Are you completely devoid of any sense
of history? CIA had nothing to do with what was taking place in Ukraine in
1940s and 1950s - those were the Stalinist years, when NKVD (the precursor of
KGB) ran rampant, murdering and pillaging Ukrainians all around.

Besides, all this is largely irrelevant to what is happening RIGHT NOW. You are
meddling with a hot conflict that is far from being resolved. Your celebrity
carries responsibility - and you are failing the test here. You preach on about
Nuland, McCain, etc., yet for some reason you are not bothered by the much more
flagrant Russian imperialism and meddling in Ukrainian affairs. Such double
standards are simply despicable.

Ukrainians are thankful that the world finally got engaged in the situation and
didn't let the Siberian bear trample all over Ukraine. Even so, their reaction
came late, was equivocal and enabled the annexation of Crimea, the unpunished
shooting down of the MH17 airliner, the manufacturing of the conflict in the
East. And you are worried about the fact that those riot policemen, who were
killed on Maidan, go unavenged? How about all those unarmed, innocent people
killed? Nobody was punished for their deaths either! It's may be a problem of
certain incompetence, etc. - but that has nothing to do with CIA or anything
else like that.

You are so obsessed and paranoid about the American power that you fail to see
what's at stake here and what's really happening. Yanukovych is not just the
most corrupt Ukrainian president in recent history - he is also the most direct
tool of the Kremlin. And you are becoming just such a propaganda tool yourself.
If you take even ONE word from Yanukovych or anyone close to Putin seriously -
you are already a lost cause. You ramble on about CIA? How about the KGB, of
which Putin's regime is a direct offspring?

I suggest you stick to those topics you are a bit better acquainted with,
because you are clearly going off the deep end into the abyss.

Mistral military ships to Russia? What do you call that?

\iusr{Bohdan Pechenyak}

Perhaps you meant "Aidar" - there is a battalion with that name. There is
nothing "nazi" about it. There are many other battalions as well - Donbas,
Dnipro-1, Dnipro-2, etc., etc., etc. These are all volunteers, who are
complementing the efforts of the regular army, which has been rendered bankrupt
and inadequate by the previous criminal regime. Much has improved since, but
many corrupt bureaucrats are still in the middle tiers of various bureaucracies
- it's not easy to get rid of them all at once, as anybody who knows anything
about administration will agree - so the regular military sorely needs help.

But this is all beside the point. Once the Russian thugs get out of Ukraine -
then the legitimately elected Ukrainian government can focus on building a
prosperous, successful state and nation. If the government will be incompetent,
the people will choose another one, as it's normally done in democratic
countries. Period.

Bottom line: Russia, get your filthy imperialist hands out of Ukraine!

\end{itemize} % }

\iusr{Igor Des}

Like any typical propaganda piece, your writings contain about 10\% of facts and
the other 90\% is a narrative spun out of them to fit a pre-ordained agenda..

A) Nuland and McCain didn't interfere but merely showed up to show their
support to a popular democratic movement which was already well under way.. The
movement was there and was bound to evolve no matter whether Americans or
Europeans showed solidarity with it or not. One has to be delusional to claim
that hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who spent 3 months in freezing cold
protesting an increasingly authoritarian government, had no real reasons or
grievances that moved them to protest and that they were out in force merely to
get some "free cookies" from US officials

@igg{fbicon.face.smiling.sunglasses}  the new government IS investigating the
events of February 18-20th.. And a number of culprits have already been named.
However, this will take a long time especially as Yanukovich and his cronies
burned countless government documents before leaving the country. For example,
the bombing of PanAm by Lybia took 3yrs to investigate

C) the truth is that civil war wasn't over on the territory of ukraine in 1920s
but lasted well into 1950s with Ukrainian nationalists, particularly those from
western Ukraine (a part that was invaded and illegally annexed by USSR in 1939)
fought for independence and against political and cultural subjugation by ussr.
Whether there was CIA support or not during Cold War for the groups that have
been fighting soviet government for 30yrs is not relevant.

D) Your grasp of the Cold War events is at best weak and at the worst
deceptive. USSR not only incorporated lands and countries illegally annexed
during WW2 it also politically and militarily dominated most of Easter Europe,
using tanks and paratroopers at will to keep it under its heel, as we saw in
Czech Republic and Hungary where democratic uprising were addressed with soviet
tanks.. If CIA did come to the aid of freedom seeking democratic movements - it
did so after those movement have been well under way and it was clearly on the
right side of history

The Americans bragged about having spent \$5bn to bring about regime change,
then act terribly offended when anyone accuses them of interference...


\iusr{Igor Des}
\textbf{Eric Kraus} 

Americans certainly didn't say that.. While the \$5bn figure is factual, the narrative around it created by Kremlin media is pure propaganda - gets back to 10/90 ratio..

\$5bn is the total cumulative funds received by NGOs dedicated to promoting
civil society and democratic institutions over 23yrs since ukraine's
independence in 1991..

The promotion of democratic institutions is a standard practice undertaken in
all developing countries, especially those emerging from authoritarian past..
They have been successful in helping most east European countries transition to
liberal democracy..

In fact, the funds invested in similar NGOs in Russia since 1991 total \$20bn..

\iusr{Maximus Berezov}

Ngo were/are in Libya, Syria, Hong Kong, and everywhere else, where the cia
needs to coup the goverment. Ngo's finance the protesters, then media shows a
huge "unhappy" crowd demonstrations, which are portrait as a regular citizens.

WHAT OTHER DEMOCRATIC VALUES YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? I really whould like to
hear.

\iusr{Igor Des}

So basically, the million Ukrainians who spent 3mo on maidan were all employees
of some CIA-backed NGO and the initial student protests were not beaten up by
Berkut but by undercover CIA agents? Is that what you are trying to say?

\iusr{Igor Des}

America is fighting russia in ukraine? Let's focus on facts and not science
fiction..

If you want to discuss the activities of the multinational energy companies,
they are very active all over the world, including Russia because they have the
experience, the technology and the know-how.. Without partnering up with Exxon,
etc.. Russia wouldn't be able to access more than have of its oil reserves..

So yes, western companies getting involved in Ukraine to help it extract and
export natural resources is great for its economy because otherwise ukraine
doesn't have the technology to extract shale oil and gas by itself, lacking the
technology to do so..

However, this is a huge problem for russia, since if ukraine does become energy
self-reliant russia will lose and export market as well as an economic lever to
keep ukraine under its thumb

\iusr{Igor Des}
\textbf{Steve Poe} 

what US support are you referring to? Victoria Nuland coming out with a jar of
cookies one day? Don't be ludicrous.. The first mass protest that numbered
hundreds of thousands took place after Berkut severely beat up and kidnapped
scores of students.. According to surveys some 20\% of the population at one
point or another actively participated in Euromaidan protests.. While the moral
support of a few U.S. officials was appreciated, the revolution was well
underway and had to do with democratic desires of Ukrainians citizens and with
reprehensible conduct of corrupt, power-usurping government of Yanukovich..

Let me just close this by reminding that Yanukovich's son within 2yrs of his
dad coming to power turned from a mere dentists into the richest billionaire in
Ukraine.. This is one of the symbols of corruption which brought people out in
the streets, especially when beatings of students started and when civil
liberties started to get curtailed

durante l'agressione usa in libia avevamo una base militare e indovina un pò
cosa è successo, poi la crimea è sempre stata fatta parte della russia devi
conoscere un po di storia, strano che che il giorno dopo dell'abbattimento
dell'aereo malese gli usa hanno deciso insieme agli ucraini prove di
esercitazione sul traffico aereo e infine finalmente hanno trovato un testimone
nn dall' occidente ovviamente e poi perchè la malesia nn può partecipare alle
indagini

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@Elena Selkova penso sarebbe meglio scrivere in inglese visto che questo è un
forum in cui partecipano persone da tutto il mondo ma, da persona che vive in
Ucraina, ti dico che : Le basi militari Russe sono in affitto e quindi
l'Ucraina può decidere di interrompere l'affitto quando vuole, perchè la NATO
possa entrare in Ucraina ci vuole un referendum che, prima dell'invasione
Russa, non avrebbe mai avuto possibilità di passare (ora le cose sono
cambiate), la Crimea storicamente non è Russa ma è Tatara, la Russia l'ha
occupata per un periodo relativamente breve di tempo (300 anni circa)
massacrando i Tatari e sostituendoli con cittadini Russi. 2) Chi ti ha dato
questa informazine sull'esercitazione sul traffico aereo ? Ti assicuro che è
completamente falsa in quanto gli USA non forniscono nessun tipo di apparato o
consulenza sul traffico aereo Ucraino che è gestito interamente con apparati di
fabbricazione sovietica. Alle indagini partecipa eccome la Malesia, solo che
per convenione le indagini vengono svolte dal centro dell'ICAO (la stessa
organizzazione che ha obbligato l'Ucraina ad aprire il proprio spazio aereo
nonostante la stessa fosse preoccupata per la sicurezza) e quindi Londra con il
supporto appunto degli investigatori Olandesi e Malesi che coordinano le
indagini (basta leggere i report ufficiali dove sono riportati in nomi degli
ispettori).

Mr. Oliver, look at my profile and tell me: am I Nazi? I've been to Maidan. My
relative was killed 18. 02. 14 (64) by sniper. Was he Nazi? No. Nazi in Ukraine
is the myth made by KGB during Second World War to hide the fact that MORE THAN
1 M Russians for fighting with Hitler army. Learn history not from Russian TV.
How much money do you need for the movie about Ukrainian revolution? We will
pay double of what Yanukovitch and his guys offered if you make it with real
facts.

Dear Victoria, you obviously haven't been following Mr. Stone's career  @igg{fbicon.smile}  if
you still hope that he is concerned with facts at all. Up until now, he was
regarded as a crazy but harmless conspiracy theorist. He just graduated to a
criminal accomplice of a murderous regime.

\iusr{Lisa Marie White}

Yeah except it's well documented that Ukrainians sided with Hitler and the
Soviet Army fought the Wehrmacht. So, I'm not sure who you think fought the
Nazis in Europe because it sure as hell wasn't the Allies, as they didn't
succeed in a land invasion until 1944. So...not sure what it is you are
smoking.

Victoria, it is stories like this link that use that word. But we all know they
only existed under Hitler and then it came to an end. I think their are people
who still chose this name in Germany and they are the 'skin-heads' and they
like the name, so they resurrect it. But you are right, it is a diversion and
is used as disinformation to categorize a specific group of people in
comparison with a group from the past. It is not very intelligent or effective,
and is confusing to people elsewhere in the world who do not know WHAT is going
on in Ukraine. And we know that we probably cannot believe what we read in
American newspapers. So your point is well taken, thank you.


\iusr{Victoria Barcelona}

Robert, the link u sent is a stupid, cheap lie. There are 3 group of people who

What you talking about, you made one big mess  @igg{fbicon.smile}  It is clear that there are
nazis in Ukraine like they are in every Europe country. Diference is that nazis
in Ukraine have some power. That is a diference Victoria. Also KGB, Russians in
Wehrmacht, it is history fact that German army had units from Russians,
Ukrainians, Georgians...but it is also history fact that USSR crashed III Reich
almoust alone until 1944.

\iusr{Victoria Barcelona}

Vladan, don't take my time for writing the same answer: go to the library.
Obviously, you have gaps about WW2. Also read definitions what is Nazism,
Fascism and their core believes. Nazi in Ukraine powerful - bullshit. USSR was
an Allies of Hitler till 1941. Good luck with studying.

\iusr{Vladan Vraštanović}

Gaps about WW 2  @igg{fbicon.smile}  I read more books about WW 2 then you will read in your

is Ostlegionen, what is Waffen-SS Galizien division, where it formed, you are a
joke, nothing but pure propagandist. And you talk me abou Nazism...USSR was
allie of Hitler until 1941, sure, but what bring them to that, do you even know
core of that, Munchen agreement in 1938, any idea? How Svoboda formed, what was
name of that party when it formed?

I am just a moviegoer. I never had a wish to communicate to moviemakers, to
send them messages or something like this.

First time when I wanted to do this was after I've seen your film Alexander
many years ago. I was disappointed, I was upset. I could not understand how a
famous director could spoil such theme. You had a chance to tell about the man
who raised himself to the level of gods.

You had a chance to tell about the man who opened new horizons to his
contemporaries. You had a chance to tell about the man who laid the basement of
our civilization. You did not do this. The only thing you said was the
statement that Alexander was a gay. You did not find anything else to tell
about Alexander. I have not written anything to you then.

You corrupted the image of Alexander. Well you can tell that it was your vision
so it is ok.

Why do I write to you today? Because I live in Ukraine! You know, the people in
my country have shown so many examples of courage, generosity and devotion to
the ideals of freedom like nowhere on the Earth this year. But you seem are not
going to tell about this.

You listen to Yanukovich. I do not think that you are so naive to believe to
the Yanukovich's words. But you pretend that you believe him.

I do not ask you why. I just want you to stop for a moment and to think. What
side are on - Good or Evil?

How will you feel when you will corrupt the image of my country.

I do not care about your soul, I think about a lot of your fans who trust you.

Mr. Stone, in your interview with Mr. Posner you state "when the government of
one's country is breaking the law, it is the right and the duty of the honest
citizen, to protest, and to support the protests of others who go to jail".
That is exactly what happened in Ukraine beginning in December 2013, when
hundreds of thousands, millions of Ukrainians, said "enough is enough" to the
Yanukovych regime, in a remarkably brave show of citizen responsibility. No
external force in the world is capable of motivating that many people to risk
much, including their lives, to go into the streets in protest of a regime that
was not only corrupt, but breaking the laws of Ukraine with criminal abandon.
Would you stand for that in the US? Additionally, your last posts, tweets, and
interviews touching on Ukraine are so ridden with irresponsible statements that
they cannot even be taken seriously. In the interview with Mr. Posner you also
state that you never studied history, only finding time to do so later in life.
Please do yourself a favor by continuing with this trend and reading up on East
European history. Good books to start with would be those by your compatriots
Anne Applebaum and Timothy Snyder. And best of all, why don't you visit Ukraine
to gather information, instead of getting all of it second-hand from the
sputtering Russian propaganda machine. Isn't that what every self-respecting
researcher should do?
