How many HIMARS are destroyed in Ukraine?

%https://www.quora.com/How-many-HIMARS-are-destroyed-in-Ukraine

All of them. Not a single HIMARS remains. They were all destroyed months ago. Which makes it mystifying that the Ukrainians are still providing recent UAV footage of missile strikes behind Russian lines of Command posts and logistics centers that can only be reached by HIMARS. And that a POW camp where Ukrainian POWs were killed was hit by HIMARS according to the Russians (HIMARS that also no longer exist according to Russia). And that what HIMARS has been targeting previously (Russian supply depots) before all of the HIMARS were all wiped out, still aren’t supplying Russian artillery with the rounds they need to maintain the Russian offensive in the Donbas.

Here’s the deal: the Ukrainians are wisely using HIMARS not to hit Russian front line units or artillery. They’re using the accuracy and range to hit far behind the front lines—to target command centers and take out supply depots. As a result, the Russian artillery has reduced it’s volume of fire (as they can’t get enough shells) and Russian offensive progress has slowed to a crawl because they lack fuel, munition and other critical supplies. And that is going on even as we speak. Which puts the lie to the Russian claim that they wiped out all the HIMARS months ago. Those destroyed HIMARS are raining fire on Russian C3I and Supply centers.

Practically every claim coming out of Russia you need to start with the assumption that it’s false. All sides use propaganda in wars. But Ukraine has lots of western media roaming around. They’re providing verified video of HIMAR strikes. And Western government sources are indicating what strikes are coming from HIMARS.
