In addition to the options in the list  below,  latexmk  recognizes almost all
the options recognized by the latex, pdflatex programs (and their relatives) in
their current TeXLive and  MiKTeX  implementations.  Some of the options for
these programs also trigger special action or behavior by latexmk, in which
case they have specific  explanations  in  this document.  Otherwise, they are
just passed through to a called latex or pdflatex program.  Run latexmk  with
the  -showextraoptions  to  get  a list of the options that latexmk accepts and
that are simply passed through to latex or pdflatex (etc).  See also the
explanation of the -showextraoptions option for more information.
