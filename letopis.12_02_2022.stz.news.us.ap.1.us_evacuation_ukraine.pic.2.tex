and Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden are
to hold a high-stakes telephone call on Saturday as tensions over a possibility
imminent invasion of Ukraine escalated sharply and the U.S. announced plans to
evacuate its embassy in the Ukrainian capital. (AP Photo/Efrem Lukatsky)
