\reffig{4-3} shows a display of an HTML file by a browser that is capable
of handling the features of the Transitional 4.0 version of HTML. The
corresponding display of the DVI output is seen in \reffig{4-4}, and the
source \ \LaTeX\  file is given in \reffig{4-5}. 

The HTML file includes bitmap pictures-for the symbols $\phi,\ \lambda$, and
$\infty$ and for the array within the display math environment \verb|\[...\]|.
The quality of the pictures depends on the monitor in use and the density of
the bitmap pictures. The 
%\iii{vb_fig_4_5}
bitmaps in \reffig{4-4} have a density of 110 dots per inch, while \reffig{4-6} shows 
the corresponding display of the last picture with a density of 144 dots per inch. 
As contrast, \reffig{4-7} is a variant of \reffig{4-3}. It is obtained by including the 
following CSS code (see \refsec{4_3_4_css}) in the compilation of the source file: 

\begin{verbatim}
\Css{.maketitle{ border:solid 5px; width: 100\% }} 
\Css{.sectionHead, .1ikesectionHead { 
text-a1ign:right; 
font-family: cursive; 
border-bottom:so1id 2px; }} 
\Css{.thebib1iography { font-size : 70\%; }} 
\Css{body { text-align: justify; }} 
\end{verbatim}
