My friend who is an American military person educate me all about Oliver Stone
and he told me Stone no friend of the US government.

Mr. Stone, I'm writing to you from Russian Federation where the ordinary people's
monthly income come to 12-25 тыс. руб. so that \$ 200-400 approx. While the income
of Kremlin officials come to 450 тыс. руб.- \$7. 000 for doing nothing in this
country and trasferring \$150 триллионов abroad every year! So why dont you make a
film about un untold histiry of the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation,
just Russia as a country, and the way the russian people have been treated in
this part of the world for ages since the 9th century. For me as a russian that
story of yours would be of the greatest interest, I believe. I have much more to
say, nevertheless...
