WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The United States is evacuating almost all of the staff from
its embassy in Kyiv as Western intelligence officials warn that a Russian
invasion of Ukraine is increasingly imminent.

A senior State Department official said Saturday that a very limited number of
staff will stay to keep communications open with the government but all
consular operations will be suspended.

The official, citing security concerns, would not say how many personnel would
remain, but as of December, there were about 180 Americans working at the
embassy. Some of those had already left and the majority will be returning to
Washington, the official said.

The official said the step was taken due to the potential for major Russian
attacks on Kyiv in the event of an invasion and repeated the warning that
private American citizens should immediately leave.

Ukraine,} the official said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive security
information.
