March 8, 2022
Morning, the people have already gathered at the campfire, a police car came up, talking to our men... I just come out of the hallway and start asking questions to which they have no answers. but they said that you can make a collective list and take it to the Red Cross, which is near the Central Road, and receive products and medicines.
Making a list just quick . But no one wants to go, some still have groceries, some are going to leave, others say, "maybe we can go tomorrow"...
They don't seem to be beating the area much, 3-4 stops on the avenue on foot from us,
There are four of us, four women, crossing the line ... across the bridge, to Kirov and then to the police station.
The view of the street brought a shock, all stores, pharmacies, tobacco kiosks were broken into, barbaric looted, people were carrying all kinds of shit with racks and counters
On the fence "Goose" there was a capital letter inscription - "Guarded, I shoot without warning"
Shoe store "Mida", orphaned people looked through broken windows for the remains of shoes.
Next several men are trying to open a shop.
Chaos everywhere, shots and flies from all sides.
Several times I had to fall on the asphalt or under the bench, as it turned out(
Finally we got to the road, there were still cars and there were cops, upon our turn to them that they were around the corner, they just opened the shop, they just swerved away.
There are a lot of people near the Red Cross, everyone asks, gives nothing to anyone, they send to write lists.
And we have a list, huge for the whole house and I accept it here )
The next day you have to come and pick up humanitarian aid.
We did it ! and we are rushing home.
There is a police car near the police station and a policeman chews "Milkway" chocolate, we almost choked on saliva at the sight of the chocolate, collectively ..
"I'll go and ask," - the neighbors grab my hand and stare at me: "Don't! Embarrassing! Let's go .... "
But today is March 8 and chocolate is in front of my eyes, I can't stop.
I suit you, congratulations on the holiday, I offer you to share. In return, he congratulates us and opens the back door of the car, the car is piled up with chocolates.... and gives us one "milky way"...
P. s. I was thinking about what picture to post by March 8, but in the morning I received a message from Mariupol from a neighbor with whom we ate "Milkway" üç´
