#маріуполь_2022 #як_це_було
12 .03.2022 
it seems to be quiet in our neighborhood in the morning and we risked going for humanitarian aid, ten of us gathered.
We walked along an empty avenue, across a mined bridge, among the shattered houses. Broken wires were lying on the road, corpses were lying on the commons. If on March 8, there were still many people with cars and things, 12 everything went extinct,... When we approached Kirov, brothers flew past us into the center of the city, there was a fight near the institute, these are literally two stops away from where the Red Cross was and where we were going.
Near the October road police station, there were no more police officers, there were several cars and military cars.
There were few people near the Red Cross, a large crowd, as there was not three days ago, while we were all waiting for rubber to be issued, we hid in a broken store under the shelves, or rather, under what was left of them.
The sound of the plane was heard, the sound grew and got closer, it became clear that it was coming towards us... a bomb from the plane flew to school 66 very close by,.. The old store building saved us from the explosion wave.
When it cooled down a bit, they brought out groceries, or rather, they threw sacks of potatoes at them, some cans of bagels, a lot of stuff, and shouted: "run ))) from here faster." How can you run with such a load under fire? (((
We run with bags, fall, climb, try to drag it all..
The military saw it and hurried to help, put us in the car, threw us from above, covered us with humanitarian aid to make it safer, because there was a fight already on the avenue
That was the fastest trip of my life..
We were unloaded at a stop on 5th, just thrown out under gunfire..
Now, knowing the chain of events, I think that if we hadn't been given a ride, none of us would have had a chance to return home.
But we didn't know it back then.
Somewhere within an hour, where we received rubber, there was a flight and the rubble from the Red Cross remained, snipers cleaned the area, houses, yards, kindergarten...
We escaped death literally just a little ..
These products made it possible for many of the people left at home to survive.
The video, the path we walked, was shot a little later, closer to May.
