We are raising \$1,000,000 for a modern PD-2 complex. It is really desirable to
win, isn't it? Let's bring the day of our victory closer. How? We offer you to
buy a new and modern PD-2 complex for the Ukrainian military!

This complex includes two aircraft and a car, equipped with thermal imaging
cameras and other «thingies» (bonus: Ukrainian-made). Designed for air
reconnaissance and combat use as a carrier of bomb loads.

In short, it's a powerful aircraft that will help our military destroy the
occupier and liberate Ukraine. What could be better?

We are raising \$1,000,000 (or UAH 30 000 000) for the «Come Back Alive,» which
will purchase this aerial vehicle with subsequent conveyance to the
destination.

So:

1. Donate any amount (in the widget above, through the «Support» button).

2. Put + in the comments.

3. Invite your friends to join via topic sharing on social networks.

@igg{fbicon.flag.ukraina} Thanks to the Ukrainian Army for protecting us, to
fund «Come Back Alive» for powerful volunteer work, and to you for financing
the important vital deal of destroying russia!
