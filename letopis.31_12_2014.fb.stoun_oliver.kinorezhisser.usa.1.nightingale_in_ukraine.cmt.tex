Bravo Oliver.... I salute you for your courage and intelligence in understanding
the real truth. Please help all of us.... thank you.

Mr. Stone.

1. Any American police will tell you that any non-serial killing, which has not
been investigated in hot pursuit will not ever investigated.

In addition. Third party could be the FSB.

2. Poles and Jews have an opinion different from that says the Soviet-Russian
propaganda. Ask the Poles and the Jews who lived in Poland and Ukraine.

3. The Cold War 2.0 began with the annexation of the Crimea from Ukraine.

\iusr{Andrea Chalupa}

You are lying to your fans, Mr Stone. An investigation is ongoing; I know
because I was recently in Kyiv talking to people involved. Sorry Ukraine isn't
moving fast enough for you; it's fighting an invasion by Putin and a collapsed
economy thanks to Yanukovych and his circle stealing an estimated \$70 billion.

Social media helped fuel the revolution; for instance, Ukrainians in the
diaspora around the world could watch Ukrainians in Kyiv being beaten and shot
on multiple livestream news feeds; and in response they organized twitter
storms and facebook storms putting pressure on world leaders to act and on
journalists to cover protesters being killed fighting for Democracy in Ukraine.

The US/EU tried to get protesters to sign a truce with Yanukovych, letting him
stay in power, but the protesters refused and threatened to storm his palace if
he didn't leave by the following morning; Yanukovych fled town the next
morning. Maidan succeeded despite the West, not because of it. If the
protesters had listened to the US/EU then your buddy Yanukovych would still be
living large in his palace paid for by stolen tax dollars. Shame on you for
lying to your fans!!! Come to Ukraine, meet with journalists and scholars and
reform leaders, or are you too scared of your alternative reality being
shattered and of losing your film funding?

Oliver Stone may be critical of the US policies, but his orientalist approach
towards the Ukrainians, whom he is depriving of any agency, reveals typical
American racism. He is essentially an American supremacist, of the worst kind,
because he combines a belief in the omnipotence of the US with self-indulgent
American guilt.

\iusr{Michael Carrier}

I have family in Ukraine, and they are deeply offended at your patronising view
that this a US driven protest. This is rather an out growth of democratic
protest by the young generation who want to end corruption and kleptocracy.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Oleksiy Babansky}

so, Soros must have been financing the corrupt cleptocratic govt in Ukraine,
because THEY had been the prime reason for unrest and crisis.

It's like, you would have a bad knee, but instead of advising you to go to the
doctor I would blame you for rocking the boat in favor of the USA. "Soros paid
you to injure your knee so that you destabilize our otherwise great nation with
false accusations!"

Yes, what you say is exactly THAT kind of absurd.

\iusr{Oleksiy Babansky}

It's so funny how pro-Moscow voices blame the US but completely avoid talking
about the sheer depravity and corruption of the cleptocratic marionettes who
rob and bleed the country dry BEFORE the crisis starts.

So convenient...

Mr Stone is a Putin's useful idiot

\iusr{Joanna Prisiajniouk}

You have no conscience Mr. Stone for not thoroughly documenting the truth! Your
comments, thoughts of history and plans for this movie is a huge lie and
disservice to millions of people and you should seriously think about this and
your reputation!!! All who know the truth will not allow your heinous attempt
to make your profit on the souls of the Ukrainian nation and all its ethnic/non
ethnic citizens along with its worldwide diaspora that knows Ukraine's history
well better than you! You have not made any attempts to contact the "experts"
of Ukraine's best on this issue! SHAME, SHAME ON YOU!!!!

I personally know a few dozens including myself who have reacted for free.

Putin believes Internet was invented by the CIA to undermine Russia. Stone is just as stupid.

\iusr{Marijka Stadnyk}
Trolls and Putin lovers still peddling the 100\% Putin funded "Global Research. Everyone else discarded it long ago.

\iusr{Marijka Stadnyk}

No one loves the western banks, lifestyle and freedom more than the Russian
billionaires. As soon as Russians make some money, they rush to the west, to
invest, to dine, to play, to experience real freedom. That is a fact!

>>> back to 1949, when the CIA and strongly anti-Soviet Defense Secretary James
Forrestal created a guerrilla army codenamed ‘Nightingale

>>> prototype of this militia up in 1941 to wreak havoc in famine-racked
regions where Soviet control was loose

you look stupid, mr stone. get your facts straight and waging crusade against
us government you should stay away from ukraine or at least talk to some other
ukrainians, not just yanukovich

\iusr{Svitlana Tuchynska}

The truth is much simpler, Mr. Stone. (As it often is) Ukrainians have chosen
European path, just as their neighbors from Poland, Romania, Moldova and Baltic
states have before. But Putin, with his fantasies of bringing back to life
Russian empire/USSR just could not take it. The US, Europe, and other factors
probably played some role, but the core is just that simple. Talk about black
cats and dark rooms.

Референдум юкрэйниансов был? Помнится в двухтысячных украинские депутаты
выбрали другой формат рады, но декаду назаседали в прежнем. You really think
USSR was something bad and gave ex-republics nothing?)

\iusr{Andrea Bodrati}

@ Ruslan: you are right USSR gave ex-republics a lot, for example the
Holodomor, concentration camps, deprivation of private property, forced
transfer of millions of people. All great achivements indeed.

Svitlana Tuchynska,.. Stay away from the EU... its a farce. The EU is a
fairytail. It failed. Even in the Netherlands alot of people hate te EU. See

Path,... choose wise!

Volunteers organize using FB because there is no other means for people to get
organized against corruption and Kremlin's hand on Ukraine, only social media.
You did not live in former USSR for years and cannot imagine the strength of
Kremlin's propaganda all those years and its attempts to still control minds
now, like it was behind Iron curtain. My husband was accused of being paid by
CIA for supporting Ukraine but I know his motives are my family in Ukraine.
Hundreds of people in Ireland self-organized on FB to support Ukraine, we were
inspired by Ukrainians standing against corruption and Kremlin's hand on
Ukraine. No one paid for organising us. We are donating and collecting money
for sending help to Ukraine because we care. We started our FB groups and saw
them growing; social media unites people who care.

\iusr{Kostyantyn Bazhenov}

This is all very interesting, albeit not very true, but why are you not equally
interested in the crimes of the Russians, how they invaded Ukraine through
Crimea, how they invaded the East of Ukraine, with their trained mercenary
groups, which brings back the memory of the Soviet coup in Afghanistan, how the
Russians were shooting at their own peacekeepers in South Ossetia, in order to
start an invasion of Georgia in 2008. You should examine your facts before you
jump to conclusions. The patterns of Russian organized violence, terrorism and
coups is very clear in Ukraine as well. Have you considered that the shooters
could be Russians?

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

As for corruption - Ukraine had a series of extraordinarily corrupt
governments. Both pro-Western and pro-Russian.

Timoshenko could go mile-per-mile against Yanukovich any day - the Gas
Princesse become a billionaire stealing gas, and is widely believed to have
eliminated numerous competitors - with extreme prejudice.

None of this justifies a foreign sponsored coup d'etat which has torn the
country to shreds. Like Libya, like Syria, like Iraq, The Empire saw them as
mere political pawns to be played with at will - and if the situation of the
locals went from bad to catastrophic - that is no real concern to those hand
which are moving the pieces.

\iusr{Eric Kraus}

You, sir, are speaking the truth to people who are used to living on a diet of
lies. Of course they rebel at the suggestion that their entire world-view has
been hideously distorted by the tame corporate media. Please do not apologise
for anything!

I completely concur with Stone's point of view, speaking as a European, as
senior partner of a Moscow-based law firm, and as a lecturer in a Masters on
Russia at the University of Bologna, Italy.

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

This post is even more pathetic then your first one... CIA was established in
1947... so 2 years into existence they already operating outside of USA during
WW2?? As somebody said "you have great problems with logic"

If on the territory of our country there were military presence of a foreign
country than i blame Yanukovich for it as he destroyed our defense ministry and
let FSB takeover. Don't be ridiculous mr. Stone you have no clue what you are
writing.
