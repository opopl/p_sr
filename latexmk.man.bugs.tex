Sometimes a viewer (gv) tries to read an updated .ps or .pdf file after its
creation is started but before the file is complete.  Work around: manually
refresh (or reopen) display.  Or use one of the other previewers and update
methods.

(The  following  isn't  really a bug, but concerns features of previewers.)
Preview continuous mode only works perfectly with  certain  previewers:  Xdvi
on  UNIX/Linux  works  for dvi files.  Gv on UNIX/Linux works for both
postscript and pdf.  Ghostview  on  UNIX/Linux  needs  a manual  update
(reopen); it views postscript and pdf.  Gsview under MS-Windows works for both
postscript and pdf, but only reads  the  updated file  when  its  screen  is
refreshed.  Acroread under UNIX/Linux views pdf, but the file needs to be
closed and reopened to  view  an  updated version.   Under  MS-Windows,
acroread locks its input file and so the pdf file cannot be updated.  (Remedy:
configure latexmk  to  use  sumatrapdf instead.)
