Это не украинцы атаковали Руси, только Россия напала на Украину. То, что Россия бандит.

\iusr{Тата Аталон}

Россия- страна агрессор, подлый и низкий. Это говорю вам (специально с

вас.

Says russian who lives in Canada))) what a joke))

\iusr{Arthur Rogers}
Showing the truth is especially hard when you are lying.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

I don't think you are real Ukrainian, ; to make war in Ukraine is your choice,
but not to make piece; ; to make conflicts in Canada is not your business, you
are really behind hundred years , you need more education, I think, or just to
be a human...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Time will show the truth...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
To: Tata;
Russia saved your brothers and sisters from Nazi, some of them were killed and burned during War 2
You need more education and just read
The History , if your Ukranian older relatives did not tell the past

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
To Tata : Symbol Hitler'ss on banner in Ukraine

"Russia saved your brothers and sisters from Nazi"

BAHAHAHAHA yeah right! But first they became close Nazi allies to help them
train and build up Hitler's army in order to split up Europe. Soviet and Nazi
troops training together as brothers, performing on common parades, kissing and
hugging on old photos. :)))

I will file a petition to put a nazi symbol, or two  @igg{fbicon.wink} , on every flag of the earth.. becuz it's kewl..  @igg{fbicon.wink} 

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Your choice... You will do it probably , because different time now , and no
option to go Nazi chamber for you yourself .,. Only jail for your safety ...


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Yaroslav Zadorovskyy , I live now and don't support Nazi, if you are ...
Waist of time to talk with you that's why war in Ukraine ,

Probably people like you or other who brainwashed and put Nazi Symbol on
Ukrainian Flag...

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
File petition Martin Schröder, but before doing this Don t hide photos in your file ...
... And go to hell

\iusr{Христина Грищук}
Popóv or Pópov, why you live in Canada?! you have to live in your the best ever ruSSia

\iusr{Sergiy Stakhovsky}

Russians saved?? Really?? Ribbentrop-Molotov agreement killed how many?? Russian invaded Poland ..if that is saving they you are more dump the I though

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
You mistaken I don't suppprt SS, you sounds , you are , Gryshchuk,
Sounds angry, that's why war in Ukraine , don't think you should live in Ukraine, it's not your Country , yours is SS place

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
I m sure , once the border will be open, you will run away from Ukraine,,

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Yes, many mistakes of politicians in the past and now , the fact is Russians
won the war , and russian people were killed by Russians , same as in Ukraine
now...many soldiers died for Poland against Nazi , I saw cementary in Poland.
Polish people respect Russian people , who fight for them .,, Russians don't
put SS symbols on Russian flag, Some Ukranian do..

Why ? Do you have explanation?


\iusr{Rob Decoup}

Nikolai you would also be angry if Russia invaded your country and killed over 5000 of your citizens!
Dont listen to russian propaganda.
Biggest nazi is the little man in the kremlin!

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

Nazi Symbol on Ukrainian Flag...

1. Ukrainian flag does not have any symbols on it - just Sky blue and light
yellow  @igg{fbicon.smile} 

2. That's not a Nazi symbol, but an old rune. Soviet symbols are also
prohibited in EU for example, but that makes me wonder why nobody from EU
accuses China or US for using five pointed star on their flags :)))

3. Finally, Putin is and always was widely supported by neonazi parties that
shout Russia is for Russians only etc. Their parades are full of young people
with neonazi flags mixed with soviet symbols and ultra-right slogans. Why don't
you say something about that for a change?  @igg{fbicon.wink} 


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Mark, I against any Nazi, don't understand your point ... But I can see
Ukranian flag on background... What does it mean ?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
On it , or with it (about symbol on flag)
no big
Differents , Some
Not people with Ukranian flag marching with Nazi flag , and people like you don't stop them ... That's why war in Ukraine... I love Ukraine and love good Ukranian people , who stands for Peace .

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Rob , how you can prove about Russian people? Do you live in Ukraine? In
Russia? Did you see that ? Do you have evidence ?

Why for expression opinions and trying to find the true , people from Ukraine (
they are not real Ukranian) wish to die to mr Oliver Stone and all supporters
(???) is it not Nazi people...(???), why they put together symbol of SS and
Ukranian flag , and why they don't stop yet,,,, why support them ?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

To Yaroslav, it's not just about symbol, it's abou angry and hate...

This type of people want to build life , piece, based on Angry , hate , wishing
to die or kill other people... even to torure them ..: do you support them ???

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Why many countries separated from Russia, most of the without killings, ???

What happened in Kiev ? Why People killing each other ??? Who is who ? If you
have prove , just put in Media or sent to mr. Oliver Stone, why people from
Ukraine angry and wish to die,! are they real Ukranian people or just criminals
... living in Ukraine

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

we don't kill each other and don't hate each other. We live on our God given
land and want to live in peace, but if anyone will try to take it from us we
will fight and we will kill - just any of 200 countries on the Globe. There is
no other hate but hate for our enemies capturing our land, but do you really
think we should love them?


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

What about people in Kiev, who were there ? Who killed Ukranians ... Russians
??? I feel sorry for innocent people who died ...no killing were in many other
countries for Piece and I independents ..,

Time will show the true ...

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

In Kyiv civilians were shot by militia and special forces loyal to corrupt
government of Yanukovych that was in fact supported by V. Putin.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
How do you know , it's not other agents ? Not foreign countries ...
too much hate in Ukraine, ;
Why it did not happened in other former republic of
USSR , like Baltic countries separated without killing people

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
You want to say no corruption now in Ukraine ?

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

Some of them were other agents - FSB in fact. There is much corruption even in
EU, but now in Ukraine government does not kill or arrest civilians just for
going out for a protest.

What do you know about hate, are you a hate expert, or smth that you throw
these words just like that? Can you give us all an estimate on exact hate
numbers or percentage perhaps?  @igg{fbicon.smile} 

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Number of hate ? You need another 100 or more years to change or be better
::you throw the word "kill", to kill your ex president , you voted for him, to
kill other presidents , any body who take your land, even own Ukranians who
want normal life, no war.. You don't know what you talking about to "kill", if
real war you live 30 min, me too

Think before you turn on your emotions ... Non of Ukrainian mother wants her
son fight for land at cemetery ...you ignoring the fact that Baltic countries
become independent without killing , they not far from you ...

I know many examples , real stories about people in Ukraine , don't play stupy

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}

I didn't vote for him just as other tens of millions of Ukrainians. He fixed
his elections and in fact was illegal president from the start. No one wants to
kill or die but it's better to die as a free man, than live as a slave. So
don't be stupid yourself - you would have done the same thing if China or US
invaded Russia, so cut your rubbish chat about normal life. Sometimes you just
have to fight for it just like your grandpa did during WW2.

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

You did not vote, other Ukrainians did ... I don't live in Russia, I live in
North America , where more then 300 hundreds nationalities live here and they
are not slaves and they are not fight and kill each other , even in your
statements too much negativity "better to die", this is your choice , people
like you ,,

make war, and get lessons from this war , unfortunately innocent people die ..,

"Play stupy" and "don't be stupy" it's different meaning ... My grandpa and
grandmo born in Ukraine ..and German soldier saved her with 2 kids from SS Army
You need another 100 years , we speak "different" language

Many statements of people who live in Ukraine are very angry , they against
Russians, same Slavic group of people, in America people get married black with
white , Asian with Caucasian , you are one of angry people and " better die"
your words ,, nobody want make you slave , slavery time were in USA, but you
support agents from USA, and don't want see the true ...

\iusr{Orest Andrijiw}

Mr. Popov. Suggest you read normal history books. Russians are not and never
been Slavs. This is fact. Unfortunately for you, your version of history is
based on old russian lies and propaganda.


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Orest you don't know me to make your statement,
you read the books ,
go back far , Kiev was a capita of old Russia

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Capital city

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}
Yes , language is very similar and close, but its not the main points
I hear you : people like you make war in Ukraine,
but you run away from Ukraine
Not sure if you also support Nazi

\iusr{Marusia Stashynsky}

You want the truth?! Go to Ukraine! Talk to the people!!
Listening to a corrupt killer and thief has no credibility!

\iusr{Myla Ustymenko}

Nikolai, Kyiv was a capital of Rus, not Russia. Russia was called Moskovia up
to 1721. It did not have anything to do with Kiev Rus, except the fact that
Kievan Prince Yuri Dolgoruki founded Moscow.

Also, I want to remind you that Soviet Union sided with Nazis from the
beginning of the WWII up to June 22,1941. Soviets not only sided with Nazis but
invaded Poland together, held a joint military parade, and had a joint
NKVD-Gestapo conference. Red Army supported Nazis. You admire Red Army. Does it
make you a Nazi supporter?

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

Myla, I did not say anything about Red Army , you do , do you support Nazi ? I
am against Nazi . Some people in Ukraine put together symbol SS and Ukrainian
flag ; you support this , they did support Hitler'ss, do you ??? It's a crime
against humanity... Be human don't send your children , if you have, to die...


\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

For Myla , is this "people " in Ukraine not NAZI ? You have to live now and
believe facts, is it humans, Ukranian soldiers sent missiles to civilian
buildings , killing children and women... Do you know that . I feel you support
more Army , and again you are one of many numbers angry people, who boost the
war ..

But probably you don't have son and children who can die there , read more
books

\textbf{Nikolai popov}, I do know what the war is. The fact that new Ukr govt is not nazi along with other Moscow propaganda has been approved by UN, OSCE and other world peace organizations.

Do you support these people? Its very immature of you trying to cling to the
same arguments that have been already proven to be false. What will you say
next? That NATO tried to make Crimea a military base and thats why Russia
occupied that place in force, while lying that its not them? Or will you say
that free people of Donbass are fighting against Nazi occupiers?

that sadly you can fool some of the people all of the time.

\iusr{Yaroslav Zadorovskyy}
\textbf{Nikolai Popov}, 

I really doubt you are from Canada - Canadians NEVER call their country North
America, but people pretending to do so often do, just as those who think there
is a line "nationality" in Ukrainian passport.

Where in all of my posts you've read that I hate Russians or other Slavs? Stop
thinking up what is missing. I hate those who invaded my land and brought war
and I don't care wether they are Russians or Canadians of origin. We've lived
peacefuly 23 years and there was no hatred whatsoever until putin started
messing up things when he realised he's loosing control over Ukraine, after his
puppet Yanukovych fled to his puppetmaster.

"Kiev was a capita of old Russia" There was never such a thing you call old
Russia. Kyiv was the capital of Kyevan Rus. Name Russia was first introduced
only in 18th century.

\iusr{Dave Antill}

Nikolai let's hope mr stone make a film about Mr Putin's corruption and murders
too . There is no shortage of incidents

\iusr{Nikolai Popov}

For all angry people " statements, I don't want read them all, because you
don't answering my questions , you changing my words and statements, you make
your own conclusions for me, and many people like you doing that , who "fight"
for humanity in Ukraine, , for the true, for the Peace and Freedom same time
support Nazi. Nazi is Nazi , any country, I do not support any of them ! Time
will show the true, and if you want the War , your choice , you will get
lessons from the War you support, I am for Peace. No meter what I say, you will
be Angry, calling me bad names and changing my words... , put lies here

Which is proves : you don't want True , you are afraid the true. "Kill, die ,
and many many similar , these are your words , you lives with them; nonsense .
You need another 100 or more years to change, be better, you forget War 2,
short memory

драка двух посетительниц кафе "Калинка" в Луганске (18+), Frozen, youtube, 30.12.2014%
}

В Луганске возле кафе "Калинка" две девушки устроили пьяную драку. Конфликт
начался в самом кафе, но драться там девушки не стали.  За этой потасовкой
наблюдала толпа людей: посетители кафе, проходящие люди, зеваки. Наряд
патрульно-постовой службы, который видел происходящее,  не спешил разнимать
девушек а просто наблюдал за происходящим.

Разнять девушек не пришло в голову никому. Более того, нетрезвых дамочек
подстрекали к продолжению разборок, выкрикивая: "Бей кулаками" и "Пусть сдохнут
обе", снимали всё на видео и выложили в интернет. А когда одна из девушек
неожиданно сняла юбку во время потасовки, восторгу зрителей не было предела.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

I don't subscribe to this idea that Yanukovych was this super-corrupt demon. He
didn't bomb countries into the stone age to support domestic commercial
factions in the energy, arms and construction industries unlike certain states
that like to hector states on matters of "corruption". No halos for Yanu of
course but the idea that he was someway uniquely "corrupt" is hysterical.
Yanukovych's actual crime is that he actually guarded Ukrainian sovereignty and
he didn't turn his country over to Western loan sharks - so for the West, he
had to go.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Алекс Каплан}

Obviously you didn't do any kind of research on him or his family. Shortly
after he became president, his sons became basically the wealthiest people in
the country. The Corruption index rated Ukraine in the top 3 most corrupt
countries on earth in 2012. All you have to do is look at hos actions,and what
he did since the overthrow; he ran to his puppet master in Moscow; that is all
he was the entire time... Putin's Puppet. Hell he was even a convicted criminal
and spent time in jail (for theft). I dont think you quite understand what
happened. He failed to sign the EU economic deal instead signing the Russian
trade federation deal, pissing off pretty much everyone in western and central
Ukraine; the only people who stood to profit were the far east Ukrainians and
people from his home city in Donetsk who would profit from coal sales and
industry ties. He was not a Demon, he was and is however, super corrupt, among
the most in the world. He was not "guarding Ukrainian sovereignty"- that is a
joke, he was ruling Ukraine as a proxy for Putin who was pretending it was a
Faux soviet Union nation state.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

I don't care about "corruption indexes", tables, breakdown charts, or any of
the other jibberish interference mass produced by globalist organs in order to
maul a man who's real crime in the West's eyes was to protect Ukrainian
sovereignty. Real corruption is represented by the Atlantic bloc who have set
the world on fire in pursuit of petty commercial goals. Yanukovych is a
benevolent character in comparison.

\iusr{Andre Maurer}

What John is saying, I think, is that yes he was corrupt, but he is far from
the only corrupt politician. We can cite examples of Dick Cheney's Haliburton
getting billions of dollars in contracts from the Iraqi war which Cheney
himself started.

\iusr{Johnny Benson}

Technocratic corruption indexes doesn't detect the war profiteering Bush
family, it doesn't detect the billionaire Queen of Britain awarding her
offspring enormous wealth from state coffers on terms of inheritance, it
doesn't detect the corruption of malicious vampires setting the world on fire
putting millions into misery. Technocratic indexes doesn't detect that kind of
extreme moral corruption at all. I don't like either - but old style corruption
seems like a blessing compared to rioting planetary pyromaniacs like goggle
eyed Clintoon and John McCrazy.

\iusr{Dianne Witiuk}
Yanukovych is a potato farmer who sold his soul to the devil incarnate.

\iusr{Myron Pyzyk}

Everybody, please. Ukraine doesn't care if Yanuk. wins the boobie prize as the
most corrupt President. You must be sitting on a comfortable couch outside of
Ukraine to make that opinion as well as not having any family there. Yanuk was
a corrupt President and UKRAINIANS in Ukraine were fed up. Really fed up. The
previous generation was still Soviet-trained to shut the hell up and take it on
the chin or even die in a gulag. Stoic people but sheep. The new generation of
Ukrainian kids were born in Ukraine or, at the very least, grew up in a very
young nation with a long history called Ukraine. Proud they didn't take any
more BS. Poroshenko et al better move fast otherwise, Deja vu.

\iusr{Aleks Djee}

@Myron Pyzyk: "Fed up" yes, they were for sure. But that's why the new regime
prohibited Russian language as second state language? Or thats why all Russian
channels were closed in Ukraine right after Poroshenko elections? That's why
they bombed Donbass? Now about "previous generation" and "long history of
Ukraine". Ukraine in Russian means "U Kraya" and is spelled like "At The
Edge/Periphery". It's former Russian Empire periphery territory and Kiev city
is the origin of Russian Orthodox Cristian Church and maybe the whole Russian
and Slavonic history.... Ukraine was 500 years the Russian Empire land and
Ukrainians and Russians were one united brother folk. Ukraine ( Zaporoskaya
Sech) asked Russian Empire to protect its people from polish "panov" who gang
banged them back in centuries... So trying to deprive Ukraine from Russia and
divide one folk into two and more of this to flame the hostage between them
(saying like old soviet generation and new generation or long history of
Ukraine without Russia) is substituting the history of our two nations.... It's
being done by current Poroshenko regime as it plays the game in which US sets
the rules. Russia and Mr Putin only defends Russian interest.

"Russian interest" is stone-age imperialism. It's aggressive, jingoist,
KGB-inspired, oil-drenched madness. Those are "Russian interests".

Russian interest is the next: to protect Russians in near located countries,
not to allow the NATO to expand near Russian borders, make transit of gas
smooth, predictable, safe, transparent and yes controlled, to have friendly and
close and trustworthy relations with neighbors and brother nations like
Ukrainians and Belorussians who mostly speak the same and one Russian language
and have more than 500 years of one history....

Ukraine had a series of extraordinarily corrupt governments. Both pro-Western
and pro-Russian. Timoshenko could go mile-per-mile against Yanukovich any day -
the Gas Princesse become a billionaire stealing gas, and is widely believed to
have eliminated numerous competitors with extreme prejudice. None of this
justifies a foreign sponsored coup d'etat which has torn the country to shreds.

Yanukovich's transgressions aren't a big deal when confronted with the
collection of toads, gargoyles, "foreign citizens", robber-barons, vampires
that are happy to launch airstrikes against civilian districts and have
pampered vampire-clowns such as "Joe Biden"and John McCrazy cheering them on.
We need to get our head around this idea. Raging from dawn to dusk against
Yanukovich like he's lucifer 2.0 whilst shrugging our shoulders at the jackals
laying waste to one half of Ukraine and robbin' the rest is like ragin' against
a prolific shoplifter whilst apologisin' for the local serial killer./arsonist
. And notwithstanding the moral fibre of yesterday's man Yanukovich, you Kiev
people are being played by the toads in charge of Kiev TODAY. That is beyond

Again, Mr. Stone, I suggest you get the TRUTH from a UKRAINIAN professor at
Harvard who knows the true history not from a gangster!! Research Yanukovych's
past!! It is way easy to put a spin on even history these days!!! Hollywood
does it magnificently! Russia has used Ukraine, raped her of her treasures, and
starved her people in the famine of 1913. Movies and documentaries have been
made about the Jewish Holocaust, but why not educate about the Ukrainian
Holocaust and get the truth out about that? Ukrainian history has been trampled
on and distorted by Russia for generations. They even took credit for and
celebrated 1,000 years of Christianity, when in fact it was Ukraine who
accepted Christianity and disseminated to Russian and other countries and that
is just the tip of misinformation. Yanukovych is NOT a resource for ANYTHING!!
He is a Russian puppet!

\iusr{Vincenzo Lachimera}

Ukraine is the motherland of all Russia. From Kaliningrad to Kamchatka
Ukrainian surnames populate every city and village. Kiev is the mother of all
Russian cities and the Kievan RUS are the mother of all Russian people.
Ukrainians are Russians, the ones promoting the idea that they are a separate
people are from the west of modern Ukraine which was Poland and Lithuania
formerly. There was no famine in 1913, there was famine in 1931-32 and millions
died all across Russia from this famine. There were many reasons for the high
death toll, partly because Stalin had murdered all the best farm managers as
Kulaki, my German Mennonite ancestors among them, and to a lesser degree the
indifference of bureaucrats in Moscow and Kiev. Millions also died on the
Indian sub-continent fromthe same famine. Ukrainian history is Russian history,
the eastward march of Muscovy was a continuation of the north eastward march of
Kievan Rus! I would not be so impressed with Harvard professors, graduate
students at Harvard are no better at geography than the set decorators that
work at CNN! Lastly, Ukraine is a Russian word, it means borderland, borderland
of the Kievan Rus, who dwell in the modern great nation of Russia that all the
ancestors of the true Ukrainian people pioneered and created!!!

The problem is in case, that many of you can't truly catch the definition
between "russians" which are dwelling in Russia now or Grand Duchy of Moscow in
the past (the population of 146 millions) and "rus'ki" or "rusin" or "rusnak"
which are dwelling on theirs roots own lands that were compound in one Kievan
Rus' empire (included: Ukraine 46 mln, Belarus = 9.5 mln and just a small part
of nowadays Russia territory). Its a big trick of history that russians use all
the time, just replacing the definitions.

One more important point. I think you're confusing a nationalist with a Nazi. A
nationalist does not hate other nations. A nationalist simply loves his own.
But when another (neighboring) nation does everything possible to erase any
traces of his/her cultural and linguistic national identity in order to
subjugate and ultimately absorb his/her people, what's a nationalist to do but
fight?

But speaking specifically about the Nachtigall unit the accusations of the
atrocities have since been proven FALSE by the international commission at The
Hague. The conclusion reads: "After four months of inquiries and the evaluation
of 232 statements by witnesses from all circles involved, it can be established
that the accusations against the Battalion Nachtigall and against the then
Lieutenant and currently Federal Minister Oberländer have no foundation in
fact". It was just a Soviet attempt to discredit the nationalist movement in
Ukraine as well as the German government in the late 50's.

\begin{itemize} % {
\iusr{Valentine Azbelle}

Wrestler Joe: Of course we could have a debate about the intricacies of the
Polish-Ukrainian relations that led to the tragedy, and we could discuss the
atrocities committed by the Red Army (and in particular the atrocities the
Soviet NKVD committed against the poles AND the Ukrainians), as well as look
into the number of the torchlit marches participants (which is quite small), or
the nature of the collaboration of their hero with the Nazis, or even abstract
concepts like symbolism vs. a real person... But sorry, I don't see a point of
having a debate with someone expressing an outrage over terrorizing civilians

Your words were "Kadyrov... he's a real man". Sounds like a high praise to me

man, and was in fact not a woman pretending to be a man, but a real man). Also
Kadyrov is among your FB likes.

I don't know who decided that Russians aren't Slavs. But I do know that "your
boys" (whatever that means) decided that Ukrainians aren't even a nation. I'm
all about all of humanity but if one particular part of humanity attacks
another, it is absolutely the right of the attacked humanity to tell the

\textbf{Oliver Stone} Спасибо за правду.

\iusr{Carol Green}

Thank you Oliver Stone for speaking truth. I've followed this story closely
from the original unrest in Kyiv and there's never been any doubt the U.S. has
been behind the coup that has caused the deaths of over 4,000 innocent
Ukrainians.

Historically, since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, Crimea
has NEVER wanted to be a part of Ukraine... EVER... and in every election they
chose Crimean leaders who would distance them from Ukraine.

• Like it or not, the majority of Crimeans never wanted any relationship with
Ukraine whatsoever. The history proves this.

• Like it or not, the majority of Crimeans wanted closer relations with Russia
and in 1995 voted for a president whose platform was to have Crimea join the
Russian Federation. The history proves this.

The Historical Record shows that Crimeans have overwhelmingly objected to the
Kiev appointed Executive Branch that has been forced upon them for over two
decades.

2,000,000 citizens in Crimea

1995: 73\% of Crimeans voted for pro-Russian president whose platform in the
Crimean elections was to join Russia.

Say 100\% of people voted.

73\% of 2000000 == 1,460,000 people voted for joining Russia.

2014: 93\% voted to secede and join Russia.

And this is with 83\% of the Crimean people voting.

83\% of 2,000,000 == 1,660,000 people voted

93\% of 1,660,000 == 1,543,800 people voted for joining Russia

1,543,800 – 1,460,000 == 83,800 changed their minds?

Percent of total population that changed their minds: 83,800 / 2,000,000 == .04\%

Here's more Crimean voting results since the dissolution of the Soviet Union
that shows the tug of war between the people of Crimea who desperately wanted
independence from Ukraine and overwhelmingly voted for that independence
throughout the years and the Ukrainian central government :

Still, you made Yanukovich look like a victim. Before airing the interview, you

his predecessors) gifted to the country. Then with the two different points of
view, you'd look fairer and balanced. Yanukovich is the most hideous and hated
person in the country, with his golden bread and toilets, and with the 27 bln
USD stolen to the country. Why you didn't ask him about that? Why you spoke to
him like to a person? Have you studied his history before? Have you seen the

The root of legends about hatred of western Ukrainan to Russians such as

killed thousands of native citizens. Do you really think it's not enough reason
for hatred.

But it has nothing to do with modern times, lots of Russians are in western
Ukraine becoz of soviet policy of assimilation population. Those Russians are

wasn't Russia's fault. Hate to break it to you, democracy is also waiting till
the next election

The people didn't believe the elections would be fair and having been out there
in the Maidan for 2 months protesting peacefully with no results before being
set upon by snipers and police. Russian subversion didn't start and didn't stop
with the Soviet Union.

Yanukovich was abandoned, for dead, by his own party and closest allies - even
before he was ousted.

Thank you very much Mr. Oliver Stone for helping us to have an independent
vision about all the situation in Ukraïn.


\iusr{Ola Sturik}

REMOVED? Check your facts Mr. Stone. Yanukovich packed his bags and fled along
with the billions of dollars he stole from the Ukrainian people. You have been
doing a wonderful job discrediting yourself over the last several years. I
predict that joining Putin's propaganda machine will be your greatest downfall.
Shameful!

Mr. Stone I have only one question: When putin's lie will totaly destroyed, you
will go to International Court of Justice to pay for you personal lie or you
will hide from justice like meny nazi do after the World War in 1945 ?

Real nazi were hidden in Ukraine as appears from facts. First Court should call Turchinov, Yatsenuk and Poroshenko.

\iusr{Сергій Гриценко}

Real nazi are not hide in Kremlin. They did meny of things like Hitler and
Goebbels did 75 years ago. In propaganda Kremlin elders even exceeded their
predecessors. And it is very big misfortune for Russia because russian citizens
will pay for what their "elite" did already.

I am sorry dear Oliver, but you are even do not emagine how much you have wrong
point of view. Ukraine is the country, which was suffer from yanukovych and
kremlin many years. And after many millions people just do not want suffer any
more cause in the eng we have our dignity. So we stand off against corruption,
criminals in law and politics who do not know what is human rights. You are
seems like a smurt person but your realasing based on a pictures (?!) and nice
conversatind with kremlin person (?!) that's it? you didn't make any deep
analizing of the situation in general from the inside. You didn't spoke with
any victim or participant of the revolution or war. 

Your point of view is not objective and not deep. Should I ask you how much
cremlin pay for this? Should I asl will you have somw matelial advantages from
it? Because only like this I can understand why you did it. If you like to not
be ashamed in the books of the history on the future - speak with us? with real
participants of the situation, that you name nazi. 

Don't be affraide, we will not drink your blood and kill you. In reality - we
are very peaceful people with high level of culture and dignity. 

We can tell you everything and it will be very big case for your movie because
we are many people and each have own reason to be a revolutioneer and stand off
against yanukovych-putin regime. Most of us very good educated people and we
are able to give you the base for objectivnes.  Speak with us - real people,
ask us, do not ashame yourselve. You will find all real unswers for all your
"picture" questions. 

We are not nazi! Ukrainian - it is a nation of dignity, not of violance! But
saddnly we should defend ourselves many years and exactly the last year from
the violance, propaganga and artifisual dirt - on what you base your point of
view about us. Very painfully mr. Stone. 

Do not turn history upside down just because you are not able to work well with
historical material, which is still in the making, exactly when millions of
participants of the history alive and many of them right now dying on the war
from russian weapon.
