They write in the net that this is a story from Kiev region when the occupiers
hoped to enter Kyiv.

One person came out of the bomb storage and saw a car with keys in the ignition
near the store. I watched her for two hours - waiting for the master. Couldn't
wait to see it. Took the family sat in this car and left for Vinnytsia to
relatives. Found a phone number in the glove. Called owner: \enquote{Sorry I
stole your car. Got to save the family}.

The master replied:

\enquote{Thank God, don't worry, I have four cars.} I took my family out on my
jeep.  Other cars refueled and left in different places with keys in zapalenn√≠;
phone number left in a mess. And already from all the cars they called me.
Peace will come - we will meet. May the Lord keep you safe. "...
