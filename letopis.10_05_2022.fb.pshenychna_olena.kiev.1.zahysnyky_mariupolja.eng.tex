The whole civilized world must see the conditions in which the wounded,
mutilated defenders of Mariupol are and act!

In full sanitation, with open wounds, tied up with non-sterile leftovers,
without medication and even nutrition.

We call on United Nations and Червоний Хрест України to show your humanity and
affirm the fundamental principles upon which you were built to rescue wounded
people who are no longer veterans.

Soldiers you see in the photo and hundreds more at the Azovstal plant - with
serious injuries at the cost of their own health protected Ukraine and the
whole civilized world.

Are Ukraine and the world community unable to protect and take care of them
now?

We demand the immediate evacuation of wounded servicemen to
Ukrainian-controlled territories where they will be provided with assistance
and proper care.
